# HTP MoE decode ledger — rules learned on silicon, verdicts, open items

Contract: `docs/plans/0001-htp-moe-decode-agent-system.md`. The supervisor
appends here; the planner and implementer read it before touching a kernel.
The tracker issue (#76) carries `hexagon` + `prio:*` and **no `state:*`
label**: state belongs to its children, so the tracker never occupies the
single `state:in-progress` slot.

**Cycle 2 (seen 2026-09-21 09:44 UTC): PR head moved `7f81560b` →
`72d9b140`, six more commits, all on the conv-block DIFF/compare path
(`Applications/CausalLM/layers/conv_block_layer.cpp`) and doc 51 — no
kernel, IDL or ring change. Still not merged; user decision.** Oldest first:

| `72d9b140` | [CausalLM] conv_block DIFF: emulate row-flattening and K-grouped int4 | same |

Reading: the author is chasing an accuracy discrepancy in the fused conv
block (four DIFF commits in 80 minutes); `7f81560b`'s "not yet run on a
device" is now run (5d190100) and under investigation. Nothing here
touches decode; a merge decision can wait until that line settles.

**Cycle 3 (seen 2026-09-22 ~01:00 UTC): PR head moved `72d9b140` →
`0a0c0402` (updated 2026-09-21 10:27 UTC), eight more commits. Files:
`conv_block_layer.cpp`, `tie_word_embedding.{cpp,h}`, `causal_lm.cpp`,
`hmx/hexkl_conv_block.{c,h}`, `htp_backend.cpp`, docs 00/51. No IDL, ring
or MoE-kernel change; one new runtime knob (`NNTR_HTP_POLL_US`) touches
the FastRPC poll window that #88 (wall 3) also works on. Still not merged;
user decision.** Oldest first:

| `32b46e32` | [CausalLM] NNTR_PPL: the prompt's teacher-forced perplexity at prefill | `causal_lm.cpp`, `tie_word_embedding.{cpp,h}` — a PPL readout we could reuse as an accuracy column |

Reading: the conv-block accuracy line has settled (PPL-neutral); the
dense-FFN-through-MoE-kernel path (`d2f0bf47`) costs 4 % PPL on the
author's measure, which would fail our gate (c) if we ever routed the dense
FFN that way. `04a2fcc4` is the one commit with a bearing on our decode
work (wall 3); the rest is prefill/accuracy. A merge decision can still
wait; if merged, the IDL from `7f81560b` forces a skel + app rebuild.

**Cycle 4 (seen 2026-09-22 ~02:30 UTC): PR head moved `0a0c0402` →
`b0a384d6` (updated 2026-09-22 01:54 UTC), three more commits. Files:
`htp_compute_ops.cpp` (profile accounting), `htp_backend.cpp` (FastRPC
poll default), docs 00/51. No IDL, ring, weight-layout or MoE-kernel
change. Still not merged; user decision.** Oldest first:

| sha | subject | touches |
|---|---|---|
| `6f8f7791` | [HTP] Keep the conv row's hidden worker time out of the mm residual | `htp_compute_ops.cpp` — `[HTP-PROFILE]` residual arithmetic for the conv row; prefill-only row, but the same table #94 B reads |
| `faba38d1` | [docs] 51: correct why the dense FFN is expensive -- down's depth, not the chunking | doc 51 |
| `b0a384d6` | [HTP] Poll the FastRPC reply for 5 ms by default | `htp_backend.cpp` — makes `04a2fcc4`'s `NNTR_HTP_POLL_US` knob default to 5 ms. Transport-side (wall 3); the #88 plan read it (author's unit: decode call transport 158 → 83 µs, doc 51 §2.20). **Cherry-picked into `htp_moe` by PR #103 (#88)**, `docs/htp_attention` hunks dropped |

Reading: `b0a384d6` is the second upstream commit in #88's area (after
`04a2fcc4`). Two consequences: (1) the #88 planner reads doc 51's poll
numbers before writing the design; (2) if the user merges before #88's
handoff, variant A of that sitting already carries the 5 ms poll and #88
is read against it — cleaner than merging in between. Nothing here touches
#94's artifact set.

**Cycle 5a (seen 2026-09-22 ~04:30 UTC): PR head unchanged at `b0a384d6`.**

**Cycle 5b (seen 2026-09-22 ~05:30 UTC): PR head moved `b0a384d6` →

`hmx/hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c` (+370/−226), `htp_compute_ops.cpp`,
`Applications/CausalLM/layers/qkv_layer.{cpp,h}`, `lfm2_causallm.cpp`,
`transformer.cpp`, two LFM2 unit tests, doc 51. One commit
(`5731b6e5`) rewrites the MoE kernel's down-matmul pipeline — the same
file and the same DMA schedule that #94's trace measured and that the
wall-2 fix issue (#100) targets. Still not merged; user decision.**
Oldest first:

| sha | subject | touches |
|---|---|---|
| `3006d255` | [HTP] Give plain FC calls their own profile row | `htp_compute_ops.cpp` (profile rows; #94 B reads this table) |
| `5731b6e5` | [HTP] Issue the MoE kernel's down matmul one block behind | **`hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c`** — pipelining of the down matmul behind gate/up in the HMX block loop; changes the 46-descriptor issue order #94 traced (rows f/g/h). Prefill-shaped by intent (doc 51's "all-on run"); its M=1 effect is unmeasured |
| `1f538c20` | [CausalLM] Fuse LFM2's q/k/v projections and their norms into qkv_layer | `qkv_layer.{cpp,h}`, `lfm2_causallm.cpp`, `transformer.cpp`, tests — ARM-side attention projections (the ARM remainder, ⑨ / #81 area) |
| `80fa1a1a` | [Docs] Record the 585 ms all-on run: pipeline and qkv sum to −33 | doc 51: the author's prefill at 585 ms with everything on (−33 ms from the two commits above) |

Reading: `5731b6e5` is the first upstream commit inside the MoE kernel
since `htp_moe` froze. If merged, #94's trace / attribution table
(descriptor order, `first expert ready`, rows f/g/h) must be re-taken as
variant A of the next sitting before #100 is read against it; if not
merged, #100 works on the frozen list and a later merge re-opens the
question. Either way the planner of #100 reads that diff first. The GEMV
path (C) bypasses this loop entirely, so ⑯'s verdict is unaffected.

**User merge decision (cycle 6, 2026-09-22): PR #103 (#88) merged by the
user as `ad714de7`.** That merge is the user accepting the three upstream
cherry-picks `fb0f02b9` (size-class ION staging), `04a2fcc4`
(`NNTR_HTP_POLL_US`) and `b0a384d6` (5 ms poll default) into `htp_moe`,
with their `docs/htp_attention` hunks dropped. Nothing else from #4327 is
merged; the rest of the tables above and below stays a user decision.

| `5622c743` | [Docs] 52: the flash-experts (cached-slim on HTP) task, self-contained | new doc 52: the author's next task is **memory** (peak RSS 5.2 GB, 3840 MiB expert arena → LRU/flash-loaded experts on the HTP path, "DSP kernel untouched"); records the author's all-on state as prefill 585–616 ms / decode 24.2 TPS and "no HTP software lever left ≥ 5 ms" for prefill |

Reading: nothing here changes a decode kernel. Two of the comments are
free measurements for our open work: (a) a ~12 GB/s ring rate beside the
HMX, which bears on #100; (b) an rpcmem-args null, which bears on #88. Doc
52 says the author's line is now moving to memory residency. If that line
lands, it would change the arena our GEMV path reads directly (#105, ㉒),
so it is worth knowing about before any merge.

**Cycle 7 (seen 2026-09-22 ~07:30 UTC): PR head moved `5622c743` →
`a996b4bf` (updated 06:55 UTC), one commit, docs only
(`docs/htp_attention/00_START_HERE.md` +1, new
`docs/htp_attention/53_int_requant_task.md` +114). No code, IDL or kernel
change. Not merged; user decision.**

| sha | subject | touches |
|---|---|---|
| `a996b4bf` | [Docs] 53: the int32-to-u8 requantization task (arXiv 2511.11248), self-contained | new doc 53 (Korean): a task note for replacing the MoE kernel's int32 → f32 → u8 epilogue by a direct int32 → u8 requant; the paper itself not yet read. Its own reading: at prefill the epilogue is hidden under the HMX (0.35 ms/call exposed, 2.4 %), the gain would be structural (VTCM `gate_off` 448 → 112 KB, the row-scan barrier) and the gate is PPL (`NNTR_PPL=1`, 62.09 ± 0.5 %); **at decode (M=1) "not applicable"** — the author's M=1 call is 1.44 ms with dequant 1.1 µs, gather 128, acc 259, mm 764 |

Reading: nothing for the decode goal. It shares the requant stage with #95
(⑱, Hadamard before the u8 requant, PR #106), so whoever reads #95's
verdict should know an int-requant rewrite of the same stage is the
author's next prefill topic; a merge would conflict there, not in the M=1
GEMV path.

**Cycle 8 (seen 2026-09-22 ~08:30 UTC): PR head unchanged at `a996b4bf`
(updated 06:55 UTC).** One relevant fact from the #95 sitting: the
side tree `htp_hadamard` (upstream `3006d255` + tooling) reads decode
**25.08 / 24.40 / 23.83 tok/s** on its own control A (`R3CY205ZMND`,
same day). `htp_moe`'s #88 B read 24.50 / 23.80 / 23.52 in another
sitting. Rule 9 forbids reading this as a verdict. It is only
consistent with both trees carrying the same transport fix (`fb0f02b9` /
`b0a384d6`) and neither having the GEMV on.

What this changes for us: (1) the "net-new" causal conv1d + gating of §4
now exists upstream in prefill shape — #82 lifts it instead of deriving
it; (2) the ARM decode path of the conv block is still the CPU one there
(the fused call runs only at prefill); (3) doc 50 §3.8 re-measured the
author's unit 10–16 % slower on the same binary (prefill 482–438 tok/s,
not 523), one more reason the provisional "now" is replaced only by #77's
control run on ours; (4) the IDL changed, so a merge forces a
skel + stub rebuild and new md5s in BENCHMARK.md.

**Cycle 9 (seen 2026-09-22): PR head unchanged at `a996b4bf` (updated
06:55 UTC).** Nothing to decide.

**Cycle 10 (seen 2026-09-22): PR head unchanged at `a996b4bf` (updated

**Cycle 11 (seen 2026-09-23): PR head unchanged at `a996b4bf` (updated
2026-09-22 06:55 UTC).** Nothing to decide. Note for whenever a merge is
considered: `5731b6e5` (the down-matmul pipelining inside
`hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c`) was held back because it would invalidate #94's
descriptor trace. After #100 that reason is weaker — row h dissolved and
the M=1 GEMV path issues `desc=2/call`, so the 46-descriptor list is no
longer on the decode critical path — but `5731b6e5` is prefill-shaped
and still unmeasured at M=1, so the decision is unchanged, not urgent.

**Cycle 12 (seen 2026-09-23): PR head moved `a996b4bf` → `4ae1ebd7`

Reading: nothing for the decode goal. `c64be9dd` is the author's version
of what #102 / PR #108 did for the GEMV row (rule 24: `swiglu` is Σ
lane-time on that row); the two prints will conflict at merge time and
one of them has to win. No reason to merge now; if the user merges, the
GEMV row's `rest` arithmetic (PR #108) must be re-checked against the new
`swiglu_hidden` flag before the next profile is read.

## 1. Rules (device disagreed with reasoning; do not re-derive)

Inherited from the PR's device work, with their sources:

1. **A `--profile` build is never the tok/s binary** — it inflates prefill
   by 83 % (doc 46 §43.4).
2. **Read `min`, not `avg`** — profile averages include the first
   (registration) call (doc 46 §48.7).
3. **Rebuild the skel whenever the IDL or DSP sources change**;
   `build_android.sh` never does. Symptom of a stale skel:
   `AEE_EBADPARM (0x8000040E)` (doc 46 §48.7).
4. **`build_android.sh --clean` drops `-Denable-htp` silently**; check
   `readelf -d libnntrainer.so` for `libsdkl.so` (mobile guide §4).
5. **Never push the link-time stub `libcdsprpc.so`** to the phone (mobile
   guide §5).
6. **`QS4CX_WH` has no CPU fallback**; a wrong layout gives plausible wrong
   text, not an error; `moe_htp_layers` must be empty (doc 46 §35, §48.7).
7. **Moving a matmul to the HTP does not pay when the round trip exceeds
   the matmul** — conv in_proj: −13 ms of an expected −65..−100 (doc 50
   §3.4); the same rule closed doc 45 §0.
8. **The DSP address space, not host RAM, bounds registration**: 3840 MiB
   arena + ≈ 182 MiB heap in one 4 GiB space; 256 MiB chunks avoid the
   alignment waste that made it look like a 3 GiB limit (doc 46 §39–§41).
9. **Decode drifts between sittings without a code cause** (20.8 → 16.5,
   doc 50 §3.4; ±5 % in `hvx_impl` #53): every sitting starts with the
   control binary, and results are read as A/B inside the sitting.
10. **Cross-session decode numbers from another unit are provisional**
    (two S25 Ultra units: 6–8.6 % apart on one binary, `hvx_impl` #23/#53).

Learned in this project (#77, unit `R3CY205ZMND`, 2026-09-21):

11. **AMENDED by rule 28 (#100, 2026-09-23): the "4–7×" is a ratio against
    a probe number no tag-validated per-call path reproduces.** The
    in-situ 16–18 GB/s is real; the 72–117 GB/s denominator is not a
    ceiling. Read this rule as its surviving half — *wall 2 is decided
    only by instrumentation inside the layer call, never by a probe* —
    and take the validated ceiling from `c_star` (26.3 GB/s), against
    which the in-situ list is **faster**, not 2.7× slower. Original text:
    **Isolated DMA probes overstate the in-situ rate by 4–7×.** The same
    engine on the same arena and skel: 72–80 GB/s contiguous, 108–117
    GB/s strided 2D in a probe; **16.2–18.0 GB/s** in the MoE layer call's
    `weight DMA` line of the same sitting (the PR author's 38 GB/s probe
    sat in between). Workers 1 → 4 are flat to negative, the bus vote is
    ≤ 4 % (noise). Wall 2 is therefore decided only by instrumentation
    *inside* the layer call (#87), never by a probe.
12. **A DSP-side bandwidth loop must defeat VTCM/L2 residency or it
    measures nothing**: the two-reader probe's `dsp_alone` read 3265 GB/s.
    Bound the result inside the test (≤ 150 GB/s or `INVALID`) (#90).
13. **Any unit; only a same-sitting A/B is a verdict** (user decision
    2026-09-22, contract §12; supersedes the earlier "unit `R3CY10WM83Y`
    is the anchor" form of this rule). Handoffs name no serial; the
    filled handoff records the serial that ran; every BENCHMARK row is
    unit-tagged; cross-sitting numbers are compared only as same-unit
    drift when the unit happens to be the same (rule 9). The second-unit
    anchor and the per-cell unit ratio (#91, ⑮) are withdrawn as goals.
    Two S25 Ultra units were 6–8.6 % apart in `hvx_impl`; that fact stays
    as the reason for the rule.
14. **Compiled artifacts are not byte-reproducible across build paths.**
    #77's skel, app and gtest md5s all differed from the table after a
    rebuild of identical sources under another path, while every
    non-compiled file and both model `.bin`s matched bit-for-bit. A
    handoff's md5 table is filled from the build that is pushed, or the
    device `md5sum` lines are recorded against the commit; a mismatch
    with that provenance intact is a note, not a void, in a control-only
    sitting — with a B variant it stays a void.
15. **`NNTR_HTP_PROFILE=3` inflates `[M0-PROF] ffn=` ~5×** (16–20 ms →
    88–90 ms per MoE layer): only the `[HTP-PROFILE]` `transport` /
    `host` / `dsp` columns are comparable across levels 2 and 3.
16. **The `generation(last 64)` line lives in the base report block or
    not at all**: `Lfm2MoeCausalLM` reports from `causal_lm.cpp:699`, not
    from `lfm2_causallm.cpp`'s block (#89).

17. **Gate 2 must include an undefined-symbol check of the skel.**
    `-Wall -Werror` clean is not "links": a Hexagon shared object links
    with unresolved symbols by default, and the device loader then fails
    `dlopen` with `0x80000406` / `dlerror RX VA 0xFFF00000 outside ELF
    segment` — a message that reads like a segment-layout bug and is not
    one. #94's skel from `2a75f7d9` had seven `U hexkl_dma_trace_*`
    (`hexkl_dma_trace.c` from PR #93 never entered `test/htp/build.sh`
    `SRCS`; the host check compiled it on its own, so gate 1 passed).
    From now on gate 2 = `-Wall -Werror` **and** `hexagon-nm -u -D
    build/libnntr_hvx_skel.so` shows no `U` outside the runtime set
    (`HAP_*`, `compute_resource_*`, `qurt*`, libc, compiler-rt); #97 puts
    that check (or `-Wl,--no-undefined`) into `build.sh`. Second artifact
    found broken only on the device (rule 14 was the first): every new
    `.c` under `htp_backend/` is checked against `build.sh` at review.
    Distinguish the three loader errors: `0x8000040E` = stale skel vs IDL
    (rule 3), `htp Context is not registered` = app-side, `0x80000406` =
    the skel itself does not load.

18. **The isolated probe rate drifts 3–19 % with the phone's temperature
    inside one sitting** (`DMA_PROBE` shape iii, 1 worker: 106.9 GB/s at
    29 °C, 88.8 at ~51 °C) while the tok/s cells of the same sitting did
    not collapse (CPU 47–53). A probe reading is quoted with its
    `thermal_zone0`; the gap analysis uses the cool reading as the
    achievable ceiling and the hot one as the run of record.
19. **WITHDRAWN by rule 28 (#100, 2026-09-23).** The "2.7× lost in the
    list itself" was `traced` / `DMA_PROBE iii`; against the
    tag-validated `c_star` of the same log the traced list reads
    **1.19×**, i.e. faster than the ceiling. Row h dissolves and there is
    no list-side loss to fix. What survives: the *paced* replay
    reproduces the in-situ 15.6–18.6 GB/s (the interleaving is real,
    rows f + g), and more workers make the replay slower. Original text:
    **The real chunk list is slow on its own** (provisional on #99): the
    traced 46-descriptor / 32-region M=1 list replayed unpaced, one
    worker, no compute, no competitor runs at 40.2 GB/s where a probe of
    the identical 8 KiB × 64 @ 56 KiB shape does 106.9 on the same unit
    and skel; paced to the in-situ schedule it reproduces the in-situ
    15.6–18.6 GB/s. Rule 11's 4–7× therefore splits into ≈ 2.7× in the
    list itself and ≈ 1.3–1.8× in the interleaving (rows f + g ≈ 20 % of
    `dsp_us`). More workers make the replay slower (40.2 → 39.1 → 36.5).
20. **NPU tok/s drifts −7..−16 % day to day on one unit while the DSP
    profile columns move ≤ 4 %** (#94 s2 vs #77, same unit and forward
    path): the tok/s cells carry host and thermal state, the
    `[HTP-PROFILE]` `dsp=` / `mm` columns carry the kernel. Cross-sitting
    kernel claims are read from the profile columns, tok/s only inside a
    sitting.
21. **Rule 14, refined by the cycle-5 decision on #94 Deviation 5:** a
    device set whose md5s differ from the staged table but whose
    provenance is intact (commit + build line + `md5sum` recorded, DSP
    sources shown identical by `git diff`) is **accepted as the sitting's
    provenance** when every variant of the sitting is the same binary set
    switched by an environment variable or config key (A and C of #94).
    "Void once a B variant is included" applies only when a variant is a
    *different binary* whose staged md5 the device does not match. Also
    from that sitting: `test/htp/build.sh` picks the newest directory
    under `$HEXKL_ROOT/lib` when `HEXKL_SDK_VER` is unset — a workstation
    with 6.6.0.0 installed silently links another HexKL; every handoff's
    build line carries `HEXKL_SDK_VER=6.4.0.1`.

22. **Handoff artifacts must be reproducible from the commit on any
    workstation; the staging path is not a deliverable.** Twice now (#94
    s2's skel, #88's whole A/B set) the sitting ran on a workstation where
    `/local/mnt/workspace/htp_moe/<n>/` and the implementer's worktrees did
    not exist, and the user rebuilt from the named commits. A handoff
    therefore carries, per variant: the commit, the exact build line
    (`build_android.sh --htp` then `--htp --cache`, `test/htp/build.sh`
    with `HEXKL_SDK_VER=6.4.0.1`, env var names, no absolute worktree
    paths), and the md5s of the non-compiled inputs (model, tokenizer,
    prompt, `libc++_shared.so`, `libsdkl.so`), which must match anywhere.
    **Rule 21 extended to binary B variants:** a sitting whose variants are
    *different binaries* rebuilt from their named commits is accepted
    when (a) every results row carries the device md5 of the binary that
    differs between variants, (b) the source diff between the variant
    commits is exactly the PR under test (`git diff A B -- nntrainer
    Applications test`), and (c) shared DSP artifacts are one file for
    all variants. It stays void when a device md5 matches neither the
    staged table nor a recorded rebuild. #88 met (a)–(c) (device
    `libnntrainer.so` `5db71a2e…` A / `3cf06450…` B in every row; diff
    `08afbb10..f3e99176` = `htp_backend/{htp_backend.cpp,
    htp_compute_ops.cpp, htp_rpcmem.h}` only; one skel `2bd7311f…`).
23. **The FastRPC `transport` column drifts across sittings like tok/s;
    only `dsp=` is a cross-sitting column.** Identical sources
    (`2a75f7d9` = `08afbb10` outside `build.sh`), same unit, same day,
    ≈ 2 h apart: #94 s2 A level 2 M==1 host / dsp / transport 2062.5 /
    1414.0 / 648.6 µs, #88 A 1812.1 / 1410.8 / 401.3 — dsp −0.2 %,
    transport −38 %. Rule 20 extends to `host` and `transport`: a
    transport claim is an A/B inside one sitting (as #88's was), never a
    comparison against an earlier sitting's row. Corollary for budgets:
    the time **outside** the MoE call (TPS token minus 22 × host) moved
    with the poll/staging variant too — 13.5 ms (A) / 11.4 (C) / 8.4 (B)
    at G=64 — so ≈ 5 of #88's 12.6 ms/token gain landed outside the
    call's own timer (candidates: the 5 ms poll keeps the calling core
    and its cluster clock up between calls; cache maintenance around the
    call; not decided).
24. **In an `m1_gemv=calls/calls` profile row, `swiglu` is Σ lane-time
    over the worker pool (6 lanes on v79), not a stage;** `swiglu / mm`
    is lane utilisation (#94 C: 5601.2 / 974.7 = 5.75). Since PR #108 the
    row's `rest` leaves it out and the `weight DMA: n/a` line prints the
    ratio; before that PR a GEMV row's `rest` is meaningless (#102).

24. **v79 HVX IEEE `sf` arithmetic keeps subnormals. It does not flush
    them to zero.** `HvxFwht.MatchesScalarBitExact` fed a row of ±1e-39 /
    ±1e-40 (all subnormal). The DSP (`Q6_Vsf_vadd/vsub_VsfVsf`, then
    `Q6_Vsf_vmpy_VsfVsf` by 1/16, `-mhvx-ieee-fp`) returned
    `0x1.7f4b4p-127` at index 1. That is exactly 8·(1e-39 + 1e-40), the
    unflushed IEEE result, and itself subnormal. The scalar spec
    (`fwht_det_ftz` on every input and result) returned `+0`. Only the two
    non-zero outputs of that row differed (`bad_gated = bad_subnormal_row
    = 2`). The spec's premise ("HVX sf flushes them") was host reasoning,
    and the device refutes it: this is not a flushed-zero *sign*. A `_det`
    scalar spec for HVX `sf` code is plain IEEE RNE with no FTZ, and the host
    side must not run under a flush either (`-ffast-math` /
    `crtfastmath` can set aarch64 FPCR.FZ). Fix carried by #110. The
    same test's overflow row (±3e38, `bad_overflow_row=127 of 256`) is
    ungated and not yet explained (inf/NaN encoding is the candidate).
25. **A synthetic single-shape gtest cannot give an accuracy verdict. It
    gates bit-exactness only.** `MoeLayerHadamardMatchesTwoCallReference`
    matched its two-call host reference bit for bit (`bad_elems=0 of
    409600`, `max_ulp=0`). It still failed its own SNR assertion: rotated
    17.51 dB vs unrotated 23.32 dB, −5.8 dB on its uniform synthetic input.
    The full model in the same sitting improved +8.0 dB median requant SNR
    over about 6.2 k real expert calls, and PPL dropped −12.7 %. The two
    disagree in sign. Accuracy verdicts come from the full-model columns
    (`NNTR_PPL`, `[L2-DIFF-MOE]` over a run, text vs A). A gtest prints
    its SNR as a field and asserts only the bit-identity to its scalar
    reference (gate (a)).

26. **At m = 1 the HVX GEMV over the arena is bound by DDR read latency,
    not by `vrmpy` issue. Cutting compute there makes it slower.** The plan
    expected that dropping `gemm_rows4`'s three dead accumulators would
    save 50–100 µs. On the device the one-row loop (B1) raised the M==1
    `mm` from 973.0 to 1044.6 µs (+7.4 %) and cut decode by 4–8 %. Under
    the same loop, the L2-hot microbench cell ran 2.26× faster (70.77 →
    31.25 ns/tile). With 2 `vrmpy` per quarter-tile instead of 8, fewer
    loads are in flight to cover the DDR latency. The `l2fetch` lead wins
    it back monotonically (0 / 64 / 192 KB: 145.2 / 137.5 / 120.2 ns/tile
    arena) but still does not beat the four-row loop's 111.7 at 192 KB.
    A compute-side change to the M=1 GEMV is read on the `hot` cell, or
    after the feed is in VTCM. On the arena it shows the latency, not the
    compute.
27. **ION arena and cached heap read alike from HVX (within 11 %, no
    consistent sign), 21–27 GB/s.** The ION mapping is not why the M=1
    GEMV feed is slow. That is the plain direct-vector DDR band `hvx_impl`
    #59 measured on a sibling SoC (21–25 GB/s vs 37 through the ring). Only
    a DMA feed into VTCM (#100 → ㉒) gets past it. Also from this sitting,
    confirming rule 20: two level-2 profile passes in opposite order, from
    30 °C and 50–58 °C starts, agreed ≤ 0.4 % on every `mm`. A's `mm`
    973.0 reproduces #94 s2 C's 974.7 on the same DSP path, while decode
    tok/s differs by +47 % (PR #103's transport). The `mm` / `dsp` columns
    carry the kernel; E2E prefill tok/s carries the position in the
    block (A's own pairs −10..−24 %).

28. **A `DMA_PROBE` number is not a ceiling; the tag-validated `c_star`
    is.** In one log, `c_star` (the per-call shape with its content
    checked, `checksum_ok=y`) reads **26.3 GB/s** = 0.36 × the same log's
    `DMA_PROBE shape=iii workers=1` (73.2). Against `c_star` the traced
    46-descriptor / 32-region M=1 list runs at **1.19 ×** — *faster* than
    the ceiling — and every other validated cell sits at 30–31.7 GB/s
    whatever the descriptor count (8 / 24 / 28 / 36 / 46), the chaining
    mode (`dmstart`, `link1`, chained) or `dst` (linear, strided). So the
    probe measures something the engine cannot deliver through a real
    per-call list, rules 11 and 19 are amended/withdrawn above, and row h
    of the wall-2 attribution dissolves. **Consequence for gates: an
    absolute GB/s target is only meaningful next to the same run's
    `c_star` and next to rule 30's anchor cell.**
29. **HVX streaming out of VTCM is nearly free beside a concurrent DMA
    into it**: `load=2` costs **0.1–0.3 %** against `load=0` on all three
    certified feed shapes (699.8 → 700.5, 695.5 → 697.6, 700.5 → 701.8
    µs/call). A VTCM feed's cost is therefore the DMA rate alone, and the
    "HVX and DMA fight over VTCM" worry is closed.
30. **One unit's DMA rate drifts ≈ 22 % between sittings on an untouched
    cell, and it is not thermal.** `DMA_REPLAY workers=1 load=0 pace=0`
    (identical code in both sittings) read 561.5 µs/call = 40.2 GB/s in
    #94 s2 and **719.6 µs = 31.4 GB/s** in #100 on the same unit; a
    cooled repeat at 31 800 m°C (vs 46 500) reproduces every #100 ratio
    within 1 %. One-worker probe rows are 15–30 % low while four-worker
    rows are within 6 %, so it bites **single-queue issue rate, not
    aggregate DDR bandwidth**. Cause not separated (session clock /
    governor vs a rebuilt skel). **Any handoff with an absolute GB/s gate
    carries that cell as its in-sitting anchor and reports the gate
    scaled by it.** **Resolved by #113 (rule 32): the drift is
    persistent, and 31–32 GB/s is the bound.**

31. **An `l2fetch` lead harms a loop that is not latency-starved; it
    helps only the loop that is, and only up to one L2 budget.** Rule 26
    read the other way round, now measured on the full 2 × 5 matrix. The
    four-row loop (8 `vrmpy` of loads in flight per quarter-tile) with
    *any* lead reads **2.1–2.5× slower** on the arena (`ns_per_tile`
    133.5 → 282.3 / 316.4 / 323.1 / 328.4 at 192 / 384 / 768 / 1536 KB),
    the damage starts at the first non-zero lead rather than at a
    capacity boundary, and the `hot` cell is flat (71.7–73.5) — the
    signature of **interference** (the box competes with the loop's own
    demand loads for L2 and bus), not of eviction. The one-row loop (2
    `vrmpy`) improves to a minimum at 192 KB (154.3 → 129.1) and degrades
    past it (`inflight_kb=384` × 6 lanes ≈ 2.25 MB, the L2 budget). In
    the layer call: four-row + 192 KB `mm` 1925.5 vs 1000.2 (+92.5 %),
    one-row + 192 KB **937.0 (−6.3 %)**, one-row + 384 KB 1042.8. The
    whole matrix is on the board; its minimum is one-row + 192 KB and no
    (loop, lead) pair reaches 840. Corollary: a prefetch knob is never
    added to a loop without its own `hot`-vs-`arena` cell, and the lead
    is read as an ordinal (the up half of stage A gets ≈ two
    column-computes of it, not the nominal KB — the fourth outstanding
    box is #114's).
32. **The ≈ 22 % DMA drift of rule 30 is persistent, not a session
    effect: 31–32 GB/s is this unit's real single-queue DMA bound.** The
    untouched anchor cell (`DMA_REPLAY workers=1 load=0 pace=0`, source
    unchanged since #94) read **724.0 µs / 31.2 GB/s** cold (27 900 m°C)
    in #113 — #100's 719.6 / 31.4 to within 0.6 %, not #94's 561.5 /
    40.2. Whatever made #94 s2 read 40.2 has not returned in two
    sittings; #100's `f2` feed cell (31.6 GB/s beside HVX) is therefore
    read at face value against a 31–32 GB/s ceiling, not scaled to 37.
    Consequence: **㉒'s feed half closes as a bandwidth question** — the
    DMA cannot deliver 37 GB/s per call on this unit — and re-opens only
    as a *rate* lever: 31.6 through VTCM vs the direct HVX arena read's
    21–27 (23.5 under the one-row loop + 192 KB lead) is ≈ 1.33×.
33. **Decision rule (user, 2026-09-23, "1번으로 진행", #76-level): a
    sub-gate decode win may land as the default when it is consistent at
    all three G in one sitting, the text is byte-identical, and the
    prefill gate holds; the issue's gate still says whether the issue
    is done.** #113's D192 missed `mm` ≤ 840 (937.0, +11.5 %) and lands
    anyway (`HVX_GEMV_M1_ROWS1=1u`, `HVX_GEMV_PF_LEAD_KB=192u`, PR

    text = A 6/6, M>1 `dsp` within 0.08 %, prefill −0.77 / +0.05 /
    +3.73 %. What does *not* qualify: a win at one G only, a win inside
    the sitting's own A spread (rule 27), or one bought with a text
    change. The default flip is its own change with its own acceptance
    (issue #113's cycle-12 comment): an unset run prints the D192 word,
    host checks green, the old cell stays reachable by env for the
    same-sitting A/A0. **Landed: PR #115 merged as `c45d4433` (cycle

    NNTR_MOE_HTP_GEMV_ROWS1=0` (`applied=0xc1`); the device confirmation
    (A vs A0, same sitting) rides #117's handoff, and BENCHMARK's "now"
    moves to that A, not before.

Once the weights stream from VTCM the `l2fetch` lead has nothing to prefetch, so the lead question dissolves if #100 certifies a feed shape. The PR's lasting content is the one-row loop, the x86 HVX-emulation check (`gemv_native_check.c`) and the microbench. The ㉒ feed issue takes them over by rebasing onto #107 and measuring feed + one-row together. If #100's feed verdict fails (no shape ≥ 37 GB/s beside HVX), the fallback is to land #107 with the lead at ≥ 192 KB after a sweep (384 KB + L2 budget).

## 3. Open items (candidates for issues; the supervisor promotes them)

| # | item | expected | depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| ① | ~~Measurement A~~ **measured (#77) → §2.** Follow-on: the dense FC's 28.2 ms/token on the NPU path is the second-largest lever after MoE; **it is not a round-trip cost** (no FC is on the HTP in that config, §2 correction) — see ⑰ | — | ⑰ |
| ⑱ | **Measured by #95 on the side tree `htp_hadamard` → §2 (cycle 8): carry it over. PPL −12.7 % (100.5 vs A 115.1, CPU 109.8), requant SNR median +8.0 dB, cost +2.7 % / +0.3 % of the M>1 / M==1 `dsp=`, decode inside drift. #95 closed. Remainder filed as #110 (p2, `state:needs-plan`):** (a) `fwht_det.h` drops its FTZ (rule 24); (b) the synthetic SNR assertion becomes a printed field (rule 25); (c) port to `htp_moe` with the M=1 GEMV requant site (about `:509`), plus the HMX block loop (about `:1415`) and the tail (about `:370`); the HAD opts bit must not clear PR #108's default-on GEMV bit; (d) `NNTR_PPL` as a separate upstream cherry-pick (`32b46e32`, user decision at merge). Gate = an `htp_moe` handoff: B ≡ A (text + PPL), C PPL ≤ A, SNR median ≥ B + 5 dB, M==1 `dsp=` ≤ +2 %, prefill −5 %. p2 because it does not move decode tok/s; it becomes p1 if the user adopts PPL as the accuracy column for `QS4CX_WH*` models. History: **Accuracy, filed as #95 (p1):** Hadamard rotation on the MoE down_proj input — fold `Hᵀ·W_down` offline (new dtype `QS4CX_WH_HAD`, block 256, 1792 = 7 × 256, 1/16 both sides), FWHT-256 in IEEE `sf` add/sub on the DSP right before the existing u8 requant at all three requant sites of `hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c`. Targets the recorded gap (doc 43, 2026-09-09: 5 of 32 MoE calls at 67–80 dB SNR, each from exactly one of 1792 elements crossing a u8 level — boundary rounding, not row outliers; column-wise outliers never measured). **First accuracy item in this table**; it does not move tok/s by design and may show no effect — a "no effect" result closes it with the numbers. Gate = `NNTR_L2_DIFF` per-call SNR / `total_flips` on vs off on the 5 recorded calls + full-model handoff with prefill/decode TPS and text-identical-to-CPU; prefill gate applies (it touches the weight layout and the requant stage). Rules that bind: no qf32 (v75/v79), host scalar `fwht_rows_f32_ref` bit-identical to the HVX kernel, CPU `QS4CX` run stays the reference (no CPU kernel for `_HAD`, rule 6 applies to it too) | requant SNR on the 5 bad calls ↑; text-identical-to-CPU unchanged or better; TPS within noise | none; can run in parallel with the walls (touches quantizer + requant only) |
| ② | ~~Measurement B~~ **measured (#77) → marshalling → ⑦ / #88 → closed by #88's sitting 2026-09-22** | — | — |
| ③ | ~~Measurement C~~ **measured (#77) → shape only; in-situ gap is the wall → ⑥ / #87** | — | — |
| ④ | Two-reader DDR probe — **DSP side invalid in #77 (rule 12); refiled as #90** (stream > VTCM+L2 or use the DMA ring, bounded result). CPU side: −41 % under contention, so any split pays less than the sum | decides whether the CPU+NPU split (contract §3.2) can ever pay | #90, ride-along step in a later sitting |
| ⑤ | **Filed as #80.** M=1 MoE path on the existing HVX GEMV (wall 1). The kernel already exists: `hvx/hvx_gemm_u8i4_wh.c` (u8×i4 over WH tiles, int32 bit-identical to HMX, m ≤ 16) is used only by the prefill "tail" path in `hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c` (off by default, net −0.5 ms there). Decode needs a dispatch that sends all four experts through it at M=1 with no 64-row block, plus the weight feed (arena read vs DMA into VTCM) that ③ decides | MoE DSP 1.35 → ≈ 0.3 ms/call if DMA ≥ 30 GB/s | ③ |
| ⑥ | **Loose end read by #113's ride-along (cycle 12): 724.0 µs / 31.2 GB/s = #100, not #94 — rule 32; the feed half does not re-open at 37, it re-files at 31.6 vs 23.5 (㉒). Nothing left in ⑥.** **CLOSED as a descriptor-list question, 2026-09-23 by #100 (§2 row): row h dissolves.** Against the tag-validated `c_star` the traced 46-descriptor list runs at **1.19 ×**, i.e. faster than the ceiling; rules 11 and 19 are amended/withdrawn (rule 28) and there is no list-side loss to fix. The 16–18 GB/s in-situ number stays real, but its cause is the interleaving (rows f + g, ≈ 20 % of `dsp_us`) plus an engine that tops out near 31 GB/s on every validated per-call cell — **not a shape or a list**. The GEMV path bypasses the ring entirely (`desc=2/call`), so at M=1 nothing in ⑥ is on the decode critical path any more; rows f and g are **not** filed. What wall 2 leaves behind at M=1 is the read-rate half, which lives in ㉒ and #113. **One loose end, a ride-along not an issue:** re-read `DMA_REPLAY workers=1 load=0 pace=0` on the next sitting and see whether it returns to #94's 561.5 µs / 40.2 GB/s (rule 30); if it does, the `f2` feed cell would clear 37.0 and ㉒'s feed half re-opens. History: **Wall 2 — measured by #94 sitting 2 (§2 attribution): the 4–7× is ≈ 2.7× in the traced chunk list itself (row h, rule 19, provisional on #99) and ≈ 1.3–1.8× in the interleaving (f + g ≈ 20 % of `dsp_us`). Step 2 filed as #100 (row h: why the 46-descriptor / 32-region list replays at 40 GB/s where probe iii does 107; gate = replay ≥ 80 % of probe iii and in-situ `engine GB/s` ≥ 40; blocked by #99 until the replay's content check is explained). Rows f and g follow #100.** **Cycle 9: #100 re-scoped to plan 100 §0 (row h's cause + a DDR → VTCM feed shape certified ≥ 37 GB/s beside HVX for ㉒, same-run `c_star` denominator), raised to p0 after #105, no longer blocked by #99 (new cells set their dst mode explicitly).** History: rewritten by #77 C — not descriptor / engine / vote but "why does the MoE call see a quarter of the isolated rate". Step 1 = ~~#87~~ **landed on `htp_moe` as `b6ebc2b7` (PR #93, 2026-09-22; #87 closed)**: `hmx/hexkl_dma_trace.{c,h}` (static tables, union-of-intervals busy / depth / blocked-wait arithmetic, host-checked by `dma_trace_host_check`), trace hooks in `hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c` behind `hexkl_probe_on` (byte-identical output on vs off, 19 descriptors traced at the fixture shape, 46 at the LFM2 M=1 shape), IDL entries `dma_probe` / `moe_dma_trace_read` / `dma_replay` (`test/htp/nntr_hvx_dma_probe.c`), the header-only in-situ descriptor plan `test/htp/nntr_moe_dma_plan.h`, the second `weight DMA:` line and the `[HTP-DMA]` per-descriptor dump in `[HTP-PROFILE]` (`htp_compute_ops.cpp`, first `NNTR_HTP_DMA_TRACE` calls, default 3), and `TEST_F(HvxDmaProbe, MoeChunkReplay)` (workers 1/2/4 × HVX load × fresh/gap) in `unittest_hvx_dma_probe`. **The device sitting that fills the attribution table (plan 87 §1, hypotheses a–g) is #94 (sitting 2); its first attempt never reached the NPU because the trace's own `hexkl_dma_trace.c` was missing from the skel build (#97, rule 17).** Original scope for reference: instrument the ring use inside `hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c` (per-descriptor issue/complete pcycles, wait time in `hexkl_dma_ring_wait`, outstanding depth, actual chunk shapes at M=1 and M>1) + a device gtest that reproduces the in-situ pattern, gate = a table attributing the 4–7× to named causes. Step 2 = the fix that table names (separate issue). Interacts with #80/#86: the M=1 GEMV path reads the arena directly, so its A/B also tells what the ring costs | 16–18 → ≥ 40 GB/s in situ; 1.19 → ≤ 0.57 ms per call | #87 |
| ⑦ | **CLOSED 2026-09-22 by #88's sitting** (`88-moe-call-marshalling.md` @ `3f9fa38d`, `R3CY205ZMND`, one sitting A/B/C; §2 row): PR #103's size-class ION staging + 5 ms poll take the M==1 transport **401.3 → 87.9 µs/call (−78.1 %)**, past the ≤ 0.1 ms gate, so plan §3.3's prebind IDL pair is **not built**; the cut splits **staging 245.8 µs / poll 67.6 µs** (C = B + `NNTR_HTP_POLL_US=100` reads 155.5). Decode **+30.9 / +41.4 / +42.9 %** at G 64 / 512 / 1024, prefill −0.9 % (gate ≥ −5 %), M>1 transport 2494.6 → 1770.3 with `dsp=` unmoved, text bit-identical at all three G. Wall 3 is no longer the lever (1.9 ms/token left); the MoE call is 94 % DSP, so walls 1–2 own most of the remaining 2.1× to 50 tok/s. #88 and #83 (the transport-options document, consumed by plan 88) closed in cycle 7. **Left open, not an issue:** whether the GEMV path's +100 µs transport of #94 C (649 → 748) survives the new staging — #101's ride-along reads it as the same-sitting A (GEMV default) − A0 (`NNTR_MOE_HTP_M1_GEMV=0`) level-2 M==1 transport (`101-ride-along.md` R2/R4, rule 23). **Cycle 11: ANSWERED in-sitting by #100's A/A0 (§2 row). GEMV 185.8 vs HMX 84.6 µs/call, Δ +101.2 (2.20 ×), equal `act`/`out` classes (65536 B), one sitting, one binary — so the +100 µs is path cost and it survives PR #103's staging. It is not a defect to chase: the same A/B wins 343 µs of `dsp` and 242 of `host`. The 4.1 ms/token it costs comes back only with ⑨ (one call per token), not with a transport fix; no issue.** Earlier, cycle 9: #105's A reads M==1 transport 182–184 µs against #88 B's 87.9 (GEMV off), which is cross-sitting (rule 23) and consistent with it surviving. At ≈ 2 ms/token it is worth an A/B line; PR #108 merged (`8e121dbe`) without a sitting, so that line (`101-ride-along.md` R2/R4) rides #100's handoff. dspqueue / resident worker: one paragraph (plan 83 §4), revisited only with ⑨. History: resolved by #77 B to prebound handles + per-call buffer/marshalling cleanup on plain FastRPC — #88; #83 narrowed to the document that says what "prebound" concretely means | 0.53 → ≤ 0.1 ms per call — **met: 0.088** | — |

| ⑯ | **Since PR #115 (`c45d4433`, cycle 13) the default is D192** — proof line `[HTP] moe m1 gemv: on (applied=0x103c1) lead=192KB rows1=1 source=default`; `applied=0x1` in an A log is the pre-#115 default and voids the sitting; A0 = `LEAD_KB=0 ROWS1=0` (`0xc1`). **Default since PR #108 (#101, merged `8e121dbe`, #101 closed; ride-along cells in #100's handoff):** env unset = GEMV on, `NNTR_MOE_HTP_M1_GEMV=0` = opt-out; proof line then `[HTP] moe m1 gemv: on (applied=0x1) source=default`. From that PR on, an A log with `off` or without `source=default` is the HMX path and is not the reference (the sitting-2 rule below is inverted). **Measured → §2 (goal progress +6.2 / +7.7 / +1.7 %, text identical).** Follow-ups: make the GEMV path the default (**#101**, PR #108 merged, so every later variant A carries it); its compute side (**#105**, measured cycle 9: gate failed, PR #107 held, §2) and weight feed (㉒ remainder, via #100). History: Device A/B of #80 / PR #86 (M=1 GEMV switch on vs off): the first lever against `lfm2_moe` 42.1 ms/token. **Cycle 4: PR #86 merged as `2a75f7d9` (2026-09-22 02:00 UTC) before #94's set was pushed, so it rides as variant C (`NNTR_MOE_HTP_M1_GEMV=1`, 6 NPU cells + one level-2 run + `*MoeLayerM1GemvMatchesHmx*`) of sitting 2 — handoff rebuilt from `2a75f7d9` (`htp/94-sitting2-anchor-trace` @ `8029b76e`). A on that head = the same binary with the switch off (`[HTP] moe m1 gemv: off (applied=0x0)`, `blocks=5632 m1_gemv=0/1408`); a C log that prints `on` in an A cell voids the run.** | MoE DSP 1.35 → ≈ 0.3 ms/call if the arena read keeps up; if not, the number says what ⑥ must deliver | #97 (skel loads) → #94 (user's phone time); first attempt blocked before any NPU cell |

Decides whether the replay timings (rows c, d, g, h; rule 19) stand or must be re-measured; ~~#100 is blocked on it~~ (cycle 9: only #100's old 11 cells and `traced*` depend on it) | rows c/d/g/h confirmed or re-measured | none |
| ㉑ | **Fixed by PR #108 (print only, #102; merged `8e121dbe`, #102 closed); row not yet seen on a device (#101 ride-along R2, rides #100's handoff).** Cause: on the GEMV path the `swiglu` slot is Σ lane-time over the pool (`moe_tail_probe_add`, by design), and the print subtracted it as a stage; the 30-slot table is not misaligned. `rest` now leaves it out, and a `weight DMA: n/a (direct arena read inside mm …, N.NN lanes busy over mm)` line replaces the missing one. **Filed as #102 (p2).** Level-2 `[HTP-PROFILE]` M==1 row with the GEMV path on: `swiglu 5601.2`, `rest<=-5588.2 (-311.8% of host)`, no `weight DMA:` line — the GEMV path's stage slots are mis-attributed in the print (`htp_compute_ops.cpp` / the 30-slot stage table of #86). Cosmetic, no tok/s cell affected, but the B row of every sitting after #101 is unreadable until fixed | a readable M==1 row under `NNTR_MOE_HTP_M1_GEMV=1` | #101 makes it urgent |
| ㉒ | **Cycle 13: D192 is on `htp_moe` (PR #115 `c45d4433`), #113 closed; #117 is `state:planned` (`docs/plans/117-m1-gemv-vtcm-feed.md`, `a566e61f`) and its base is now the `htp_moe` head, not PR #115's branch — its sitting's A is the D192 default and carries #113's A/A0 confirmation.** **Cycle 12 (#113 → §2): compute half CLOSED, feed half re-filed as a rate lever.** The 2 × 5 (loop × lead) matrix is complete (rule 31): the lead harms the four-row loop, helps the one-row loop only to 192 KB, and the minimum D192 (`mm` 937.0, −6.3 %) misses the 840 gate; **the user lands D192 as the default anyway** (rule 33, PR #115, #113 in progress for the flip; decode +4.11 / +3.29 / +4.26 %). The ride-along (724.0 µs / 31.2 GB/s, rule 32) says 31–32 GB/s is the real DMA bound, so the feed half closes *as a 37 GB/s question* and the VTCM feed is worth what #100 measured: `f2` **31.6 GB/s beside HVX vs 23.5 GB/s** for D192's direct read = **≈ 1.33×** → `mm` ≈ 710 µs, ≈ −5 ms/token, with the one-row loop's ≈ 240 µs compute hidden under the feed (rule 29). **Filed as the ㉒ feed issue (**#117**, p1, `state:planned` since cycle 12's planner, `a566e61f`):** two linear descriptors per expert (`f2`: 8 descriptors, `dst=strided`, depth 2), gate `mm` ≤ 760 at M==1 (−19 % vs D192's 937), decode ≥ A at all three G, text = A, `bit_identical yes`, prefill −5 % on M>1 `dsp`, plus the `DMA_REPLAY` anchor cell in-sitting (rule 30). It must not re-import the 46-descriptor interleaving (rows f + g): at M=1 the ring carries only the expert's own `wh_bytes`, issued one expert ahead. #114 (up-half lead, p2) is moot if it lands. Earlier: **Cycle 11, after #100 and the user's direction ("stop leaning on the DMA numbers, take the compute-side wins first"): the feed half is DEMOTED and the lever is the `l2fetch` lead.** #100 measured the DMA feed at **31.6 GB/s** (best `f2`) against the GEMV's own direct arena read at 21–27, i.e. ≈ **1.2 ×**, not the 1.6 × (37 / 22.6) cycle 9 assumed — and on a sitting whose DMA is itself 22 % low (rule 30). VTCM staging therefore buys ≈ 690 → ≈ 550 µs of feed at best, and it costs a ring, a double-buffer and a prefill-gate risk. The cheap half is that **the feed is DDR latency, not bandwidth** (rule 26), and the only lever measured against it is monotonic and unsaturated: `l2fetch` lead 0 / 64 / 192 KB = 145.2 / 137.5 / 120.2 ns/tile. #105 confounded the lead with the loop shape — A is four-row with a zero-lead self-prefetch, B1/B2/B3 are one-row with lead 0/64/192 — so **the four-row loop has never been measured with any lead at all**. Filed as **#113 (p0)**: complete the 2 × N matrix, sweep past 192 KB, cross the expert boundary, land the winner (which decides PR #107's default and whether #107 lands at all). Gate `mm` ≤ 840 µs at M==1 (−13.7 % vs #100 A_L2's 980.9). **#114 (p1)** carries the next-expert / cross-op prefetch. The feed half stays open but unfiled, behind ⑥'s ride-along. Earlier: **Cycle 9: compute half measured (#105 → §2): gate failed. The best loop (one-row + 192 KB lead) gives `mm` 930.9 vs 973.0 (−4.3 %). The feed is ≈ 74 % of `mm` under that loop and ≈ 37 % under the four-row one. The feed half is the lever. It needs #107's loop to hide the compute: ≈ 240 µs vs the ≈ 590 the four-row loop leaves. PR #107 is held, and the feed issue rebases onto it. Order: #100 certifies a DDR → VTCM descriptor shape (≥ 37 GB/s beside HVX). Then the ㉒ feed issue is filed with that shape, gated `mm` ≤ 600 at M==1, text = A, prefill −5 %, and its A/B measures feed + one-row loop against A. If #100 certifies nothing, land #107 with a lead sweep (≥ 192 KB) and close ㉒ at what the arena allows.** Earlier: **Split (user direction, cycle 6, 2026-09-22). Compute side filed as #105 (p0, `state:needs-plan`):** one-row `gemm_rows1` at `m = 1` (drops `gemm_rows4`'s three dead accumulators; accumulation order unchanged, so int32 stays bit-identical to the HMX), `l2fetch` lead / distance, and the lane split over the pool. It needs no ring, so it does not wait for #100. The handoff sets `NNTR_MOE_HTP_M1_GEMV=1` explicitly in A and B, which keeps it independent of #101. **Feed side (remainder, not yet an issue):** VTCM staging of each expert's `wh_bytes` by DMA (two linear descriptors per expert); it must not re-import row h's slow list, so it is filed once #100 names h's cause. Evidence: C's `mm` 783 → 975 µs, a direct arena read at ≈ 22.6 GB/s effective, lane-bound (`swiglu / mm = 5.75`; plan 101 §3.4). Supervisor's estimate, not measured: the dead `vrmpy` are ~50–100 µs of the 975, and `hvx_impl` #59 measured direct DDR vector reads at 21–25 GB/s against 37 through the ring. So #105 alone may stop above 600; its ride-along microbench (arena vs VTCM copy × 4-acc vs 1-acc) sizes the feed half. Combined gate for ㉒ = `mm` ≤ 600 µs at M==1 with text identical | MoE dsp 1033 → ≈ 660 µs/call (`mm` 973 → ≈ 600; ≈ −8 ms/token) | feed: #100 → feed issue; compute: PR #107 (held) |
| ⑰ | **`fully_connected` 28.2 vs 10.3 ms/token on the NPU run with no FC on the HTP** (§2 ① correction). Not a round trip; candidates: CPU thread over-splitting / contention with the FastRPC poll thread (doc 48 §2 ③), CPU DVFS while the DSP runs. 18 ms/token is the second-largest single lever after MoE and needs no DSP code if it is a threading matter. Decide with one extra profile cell (`NNTR_NUM_THREADS=4` on the NPU model, or the non-WH `QS4CX` model with `NNTR_MOE_HTP_DECODE` off/on) — candidate ride-along for #94 or its own issue — **#94 s2 skipped the ride-along (budget)**, so this still needs its cell | **Resized in cycle 7 (§2 budget row):** in TPS terms the whole outside-the-MoE-call time is 11.1–13.7 ms/token on the pre-#103 binaries (#94 s2 A and C, #88 A) and **8.4 (G=64) / 9.6 (G=512) on `htp_moe` head** (#88 B — the 5 ms poll / staging moved ≈ 5 ms of it, rule 23), against a ≈ 6.5 ms byte floor; the profile's 28.2 vs 10.3 is mostly the `--profile` build's own ≈ 20 ms/token. So ⑰ is worth ≈ 2–3 ms/token now, not 18: no issue; still a cheap ride-along (`NNTR_NUM_THREADS=4` on the NPU model, TPS binary) in the next sitting that has room | ≈ −2..−3 ms/token on the NPU path | next sitting's ride-along |

## 3a. Guide and tooling notes

* **`docs/htp_moe/guide/`** exists since PR #92 (`cffcec3e`, merged
  `750428e8`, 2026-09-22): five self-contained English pages
  (`index`, `01-run-it`, `02-decode-path`, `03-performance`,
  `04-glossary`), decode only. The guide writer refreshes it on every
  filled handoff and every merged kernel/app PR (contract §8 step 4); its
  numbers are copied from BENCHMARK.md, never measured.
* Guide-writer findings folded into this ledger: (a) the FC 28.2 vs 10.3
  ms/token question (§2 ① correction, ⑰); (b)
  `Applications/CausalLM/install_android.sh` takes **no `--model`
  argument** in this tree — it pushes binaries and prints the `adb push`
  of a model dir as a hint (`install_android.sh:268–279`); handoffs must
  spell out the model push themselves (#77's did).
* **Rebuilding a handoff set on a fresh checkout (#105 run notes, cycle 9;
  rule 22):** four gaps the recipes did not state, now in the
  `hexagon-gates` skill rung 3. (1) A new `git worktree` has **empty
  `subprojects/`**. `build_android.sh` then dies on `iniparser.h` after
  ≈ 15 min. Run `git submodule update --init --depth 1` (or copy the
  populated dirs) first. (2) `Applications/CausalLM/lib/libtokenizers_android_c.a`
  is per-checkout. Copy it or rebuild it with `build_tokenizer_android.sh`.
  (3) `libc++_shared.so` may not appear under `jni/obj/local/arm64-v8a/`.
  Take it from the NDK r30 sysroot
  (`toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/sysroot/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-android/`,
  md5 `b1586b9b…`). (4) `HEXKL_ROOT` differs between workstations. Export
  it explicitly next to `HEXKL_SDK_VER=6.4.0.1`, and never rely on
  `env.sh`'s default path.

## 4. Reusable code on `hvx_impl` (survey 2026-09-21; read with `git show hvx_impl:<path>`)

`hvx_impl` (Qwen3-0.6B, W8A8 HVX-only) is frozen but its kernels and
harness are device-validated. What lifts, in value order:

| lift | from | serves | adaptation |
|---|---|---|---|
| m=1 decode attention with a DSP-resident KV cache (K stored transposed `[head_dim][max_seq]` so one vector covers 64 positions; workers split by kv head) | `nntrainer/tensor/hexagon/htp/ops/hvx-attn.c` (152 LOC) | ⑨ attention | drop the token loop (m=1); per-worker score scratch from the orchestrator; KV dtype vs `hexkl_kv_quant.c` (fp16 there, u8 here → dequant in the score loop if u8 stays); `wp_run` → `hvx_worker_pool_run` |
| "DSP owns the graph": validate the op list once at init, then `forward(tokens, pos → logits)` runs `for op in ops: table[kind]()` with per-op pcycles and one FARF line per call | `htp/htp_graph.{h,c}` (~200 of 546 LOC), `htp/nntr_htp.idl` (3 methods incl. `forward_debug`), `htp/executor.c` (fd mmap + `AEE_EALREADY` handling) | ⑨ one call per token | add a `forward` entry beside the per-op IDL; rebuild `next_mm[]` over the LFM2.5 op sequence; repopulate the op table with MoE/conv1d/dense kinds |
| cross-op weight prefetch: two op-independent VTCM half-slabs so the last chunk of op N kicks chunk 0 of op N+1 while norm/RoPE/attention run in between | `htp/ops/hvx-matmul.c` `mm_slab`/`mm_worker_vtcm`/`mm_pf_kick` (~120 LOC) | ⑥ ⑨ | hvx_impl's per-worker push/pop DMA FIFO vs our global index ring (`hexkl_dma_ring_push2d` + `next_idx`/`wait`): rewrite the pipeline loop; keep the "drain, never abandon" rule for a prefetch left by another op |
| host E2E harness without the CausalLM app: `hexagon_e2e_test` (`--tokens/--chunk/--steps/--eval/--dump-*`, `E2E` lines), `HexagonRunner`, `RpcmemBuffer`, md5-gated `run_e2e_test.sh`, `summ_farf_prof.py`, `find_divergence.py` (needs `forward_debug`), `make_tokens.py` | `test/hexagon/hexagon_e2e_test.cpp`, `nntrainer/tensor/hexagon/host/*`, `tools/hexagon/*` (~650 LOC) | measurement | replace the qwen3 lowering/config with LFM2.5's; `NNTR_HAVE_FASTRPC_MAP_STATIC` probe into `test/htp/build.sh` |
| small ops: RMSNorm (also per-head q/k norm via `FLAG_PER_HEAD`), RoPE (`rope_rotate`, 20 lines, head_dim 128 hard-coded — LFM2.5 is 64), the shared fp32 cos/sin row `nntr_htp_rope.h`, and the quantizer's integer-only rounding recipe (one qf32 product, then sign/exp/significand split, ties-to-even) that made results v75/v79-portable | `htp/ops/hvx-rmsnorm.c`, `hvx-rope.c`, `nntr_htp_rope.h`, `hvx/hvx-quant.h` (~295 LOC) | ⑨ | activation dtype (fp16 there, f32 residual here); our quantizer is asymmetric u8 with zero point — port the rounding only if `hvx_quant_u8.c` still reads sf bits after a qf32 op |

Not lifted: the W8A8 tiled `vrmpy` matmul (wrong layout for int4; our `hvx_gemm_u8i4_wh_col` is the math), `dma-queue.c` (we have `hexkl_dma_ring.c`), the worker pool (ours is richer; note the opposite HVX-context convention: hvx_impl locks a unit per worker and leaves none for the caller, ours runs index 0 inline), the qwen3 lowering/packer/app glue, the simulator harness (no simulator here). Causal depthwise conv1d (L=3) + gating has no counterpart on either branch: net-new.

Silicon rules from `hvx_impl`'s HEXAGON.md §7 that bind here too: compute in fp32 inside an op and narrow to fp16 once (`Vhf_equals_Vqf16` after a qf16 multiply rounds badly, 2.7 % PPL); clamp the SiLU exp argument (already 85 here, doc 44); `-mhvx-ieee-fp` is required for fp16 intrinsics on toolchain 19; int32 `vrmpy` sums are exact in any order, divergence enters only in the epilogue; qf32→sf conversion differs between v75 and v79, so quantizers decode integers, never sf bits; HVX code runs only on threads that own an HVX context; validate `k` bounds for exact int accumulation; never compare wall-clock tok/s across units, report pcycles and `pcycles_per_us`.
