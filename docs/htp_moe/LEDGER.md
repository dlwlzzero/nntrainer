# HTP MoE decode ledger — rules learned on silicon, verdicts, open items

Contract: `docs/plans/0001-htp-moe-decode-agent-system.md`. The supervisor
appends here; the planner and implementer read it before touching a kernel.
The tracker issue (#76) carries `hexagon` + `prio:*` and **no `state:*`
label**: state belongs to its children, so the tracker never occupies the
single `state:in-progress` slot.

**Cycle 2 (seen 2026-09-21 09:44 UTC): PR head moved `7f81560b` →
`72d9b140`, six more commits, all on the conv-block DIFF/compare path
(`Applications/CausalLM/layers/conv_block_layer.cpp`) and doc 51 — no

Reading: the author is chasing an accuracy discrepancy in the fused conv
block (four DIFF commits in 80 minutes); `7f81560b`'s "not yet run on a
device" is now run (5d190100) and under investigation. Nothing here
touches decode; a merge decision can wait until that line settles.

`hmx/hexkl_conv_block.{c,h}`, `htp_backend.cpp`, docs 00/51. No IDL, ring

Reading: the conv-block accuracy line has settled (PPL-neutral); the
dense-FFN-through-MoE-kernel path (`d2f0bf47`) costs 4 % PPL on the
author's measure, which would fail our gate (c) if we ever routed the dense
FFN that way. `04a2fcc4` is the one commit with a bearing on our decode
work (wall 3); the rest is prefill/accuracy. A merge decision can still
wait; if merged, the IDL from `7f81560b` forces a skel + app rebuild.

**Cycle 4 (seen 2026-09-22 ~02:30 UTC): PR head moved `0a0c0402` →
`b0a384d6` (updated 2026-09-22 01:54 UTC), three more commits. Files:
`htp_compute_ops.cpp` (profile accounting), `htp_backend.cpp` (FastRPC
poll default), docs 00/51. No IDL, ring, weight-layout or MoE-kernel
change. Still not merged; user decision.** Oldest first:

| sha | subject | touches |
|---|---|---|
| `6f8f7791` | [HTP] Keep the conv row's hidden worker time out of the mm residual | `htp_compute_ops.cpp` — `[HTP-PROFILE]` residual arithmetic for the conv row; prefill-only row, but the same table #94 B reads |
| `faba38d1` | [docs] 51: correct why the dense FFN is expensive -- down's depth, not the chunking | doc 51 |
| `b0a384d6` | [HTP] Poll the FastRPC reply for 5 ms by default | `htp_backend.cpp` — makes `04a2fcc4`'s `NNTR_HTP_POLL_US` knob default to 5 ms. Transport-side (wall 3); the #88 plan read it (author's unit: decode call transport 158 → 83 µs, doc 51 §2.20). **Cherry-picked into `htp_moe` by PR #103 (#88)**, `docs/htp_attention` hunks dropped |

Reading: `b0a384d6` is the second upstream commit in #88's area (after
`04a2fcc4`). Two consequences: (1) the #88 planner reads doc 51's poll
numbers before writing the design; (2) if the user merges before #88's
handoff, variant A of that sitting already carries the 5 ms poll and #88
is read against it — cleaner than merging in between. Nothing here touches
#94's artifact set.

**Cycle 5a (seen 2026-09-22 ~04:30 UTC): PR head unchanged at `b0a384d6`.**

`Applications/CausalLM/layers/qkv_layer.{cpp,h}`, `lfm2_causallm.cpp`,
`transformer.cpp`, two LFM2 unit tests, doc 51. One commit
(`5731b6e5`) rewrites the MoE kernel's down-matmul pipeline — the same
file and the same DMA schedule that #94's trace measured and that the
wall-2 fix issue (#100) targets. Still not merged; user decision.**
Oldest first:

| sha | subject | touches |
|---|---|---|
| `3006d255` | [HTP] Give plain FC calls their own profile row | `htp_compute_ops.cpp` (profile rows; #94 B reads this table) |
| `5731b6e5` | [HTP] Issue the MoE kernel's down matmul one block behind | **`hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c`** — pipelining of the down matmul behind gate/up in the HMX block loop; changes the 46-descriptor issue order #94 traced (rows f/g/h). Prefill-shaped by intent (doc 51's "all-on run"); its M=1 effect is unmeasured |
| `1f538c20` | [CausalLM] Fuse LFM2's q/k/v projections and their norms into qkv_layer | `qkv_layer.{cpp,h}`, `lfm2_causallm.cpp`, `transformer.cpp`, tests — ARM-side attention projections (the ARM remainder, ⑨ / #81 area) |
| `80fa1a1a` | [Docs] Record the 585 ms all-on run: pipeline and qkv sum to −33 | doc 51: the author's prefill at 585 ms with everything on (−33 ms from the two commits above) |

Reading: `5731b6e5` is the first upstream commit inside the MoE kernel
since `htp_moe` froze. If merged, #94's trace / attribution table
(descriptor order, `first expert ready`, rows f/g/h) must be re-taken as
variant A of the next sitting before #100 is read against it; if not
merged, #100 works on the frozen list and a later merge re-opens the
question. Either way the planner of #100 reads that diff first. The GEMV
path (C) bypasses this loop entirely, so ⑯'s verdict is unaffected.

**User merge decision (cycle 6, 2026-09-22): PR #103 (#88) merged by the
user as `ad714de7`.** That merge is the user accepting the three upstream
cherry-picks `fb0f02b9` (size-class ION staging), `04a2fcc4`
(`NNTR_HTP_POLL_US`) and `b0a384d6` (5 ms poll default) into `htp_moe`,
with their `docs/htp_attention` hunks dropped. Nothing else from #4327 is

| `aa371dd2` | [HTP] Revert the early gate_up chunks and the rpcmem MoE args; keep the pooled FC epilogue | net: `hexkl_mm_u8i4_dma.c` plain-FC epilogue double-buffered onto the pool (prefill FC calls, not on our decode config); two **measured negatives** left as comments: (a) pushing the next expert's gate_up chunks early put the activation behind them in the ring, GATHER 84 → 747 µs/call (388 at decode), "the DMA moves ~12 GB/s beside the HMX, not the idle 33" (doc 51 §2.26) — input for #100 / rows f–g; (b) the MoE call's five small sequences from one rpcmem buffer: transport 627 → 605 µs, noise, "the gap to the FC calls' ~400 is the call's length … a call longer than the poll window ends in the interrupt-driven wait" — input for reading handoff 88 |
| `7ada48b7` | [Docs] Record the pooled-FC-only run and the poll 9000 experiment | doc 51 (a longer poll window tried) |
| `5622c743` | [Docs] 52: the flash-experts (cached-slim on HTP) task, self-contained | new doc 52: the author's next task is **memory** (peak RSS 5.2 GB, 3840 MiB expert arena → LRU/flash-loaded experts on the HTP path, "DSP kernel untouched"); records the author's all-on state as prefill 585–616 ms / decode 24.2 TPS and "no HTP software lever left ≥ 5 ms" for prefill |

Reading: nothing here changes a decode kernel. Two of the comments are
free measurements for our open work: (a) a ~12 GB/s ring rate beside the
HMX, which bears on #100; (b) an rpcmem-args null, which bears on #88. Doc
52 says the author's line is now moving to memory residency. If that line
lands, it would change the arena our GEMV path reads directly (#105, ㉒),
so it is worth knowing about before any merge.

**Cycle 7 (seen 2026-09-22 ~07:30 UTC): PR head moved `5622c743` →
`a996b4bf` (updated 06:55 UTC), one commit, docs only
(`docs/htp_attention/00_START_HERE.md` +1, new
`docs/htp_attention/53_int_requant_task.md` +114). No code, IDL or kernel
change. Not merged; user decision.**

| sha | subject | touches |
|---|---|---|
| `a996b4bf` | [Docs] 53: the int32-to-u8 requantization task (arXiv 2511.11248), self-contained | new doc 53 (Korean): a task note for replacing the MoE kernel's int32 → f32 → u8 epilogue by a direct int32 → u8 requant; the paper itself not yet read. Its own reading: at prefill the epilogue is hidden under the HMX (0.35 ms/call exposed, 2.4 %), the gain would be structural (VTCM `gate_off` 448 → 112 KB, the row-scan barrier) and the gate is PPL (`NNTR_PPL=1`, 62.09 ± 0.5 %); **at decode (M=1) "not applicable"** — the author's M=1 call is 1.44 ms with dequant 1.1 µs, gather 128, acc 259, mm 764 |

Reading: nothing for the decode goal. It shares the requant stage with #95
(⑱, Hadamard before the u8 requant, PR #106), so whoever reads #95's
verdict should know an int-requant rewrite of the same stage is the
author's next prefill topic; a merge would conflict there, not in the M=1
GEMV path.

**Cycle 8 (seen 2026-09-22 ~08:30 UTC): PR head unchanged at `a996b4bf`
(updated 06:55 UTC).** One relevant fact from the #95 sitting: the
side tree `htp_hadamard` (upstream `3006d255` + tooling) reads decode
**25.08 / 24.40 / 23.83 tok/s** on its own control A (`R3CY205ZMND`,
same day). `htp_moe`'s #88 B read 24.50 / 23.80 / 23.52 in another
sitting. Rule 9 forbids reading this as a verdict. It is only
consistent with both trees carrying the same transport fix (`fb0f02b9` /
`b0a384d6`) and neither having the GEMV on.

What this changes for us: (1) the "net-new" causal conv1d + gating of §4
now exists upstream in prefill shape — #82 lifts it instead of deriving
it; (2) the ARM decode path of the conv block is still the CPU one there
(the fused call runs only at prefill); (3) doc 50 §3.8 re-measured the
author's unit 10–16 % slower on the same binary (prefill 482–438 tok/s,
not 523), one more reason the provisional "now" is replaced only by #77's
control run on ours; (4) the IDL changed, so a merge forces a
skel + stub rebuild and new md5s in BENCHMARK.md.

**Cycle 9 (seen 2026-09-22): PR head unchanged at `a996b4bf` (updated

**Cycle 11 (seen 2026-09-23): PR head unchanged at `a996b4bf` (updated
2026-09-22 06:55 UTC).** Nothing to decide. Note for whenever a merge is
considered: `5731b6e5` (the down-matmul pipelining inside
`hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c`) was held back because it would invalidate #94's
descriptor trace. After #100 that reason is weaker — row h dissolved and
the M=1 GEMV path issues `desc=2/call`, so the 46-descriptor list is no
longer on the decode critical path — but `5731b6e5` is prefill-shaped
and still unmeasured at M=1, so the decision is unchanged, not urgent.

change. Not merged; user decision.** Oldest first:

Reading: nothing for the decode goal. `c64be9dd` is the author's version
of what #102 / PR #108 did for the GEMV row (rule 24: `swiglu` is Σ
lane-time on that row); the two prints will conflict at merge time and
one of them has to win. No reason to merge now; if the user merges, the
GEMV row's `rest` arithmetic (PR #108) must be re-checked against the new
`swiglu_hidden` flag before the next profile is read.

**Cycle 15 (seen 2026-09-23): PR head unchanged at `4ae1ebd7` (updated
2026-09-23 02:14 UTC). USER DECISION OF RECORD (2026-09-23, "PR #4327
최신 거도 다 반영해줘", contract §5 Q16): the full sync is ordered — every
commit of the PR head onto `htp_moe` as one PR, filed as #120 (p1,
`state:planned`, implementer on it this cycle). Merge-base `2ce38d65`, 40
commits, 44 files, +5667/−998. What `htp_moe` already carries from that
range, for checking #120's PR body against:**

| upstream | on `htp_moe` as | via |
|---|---|---|
| `fb0f02b9` size-class ION staging | `e75011e8` | PR #103 (#88, merged `ad714de7`), `docs/htp_attention` hunk dropped |

| `b0a384d6` 5 ms poll default | `d84b7d69` | PR #103, docs hunks dropped |
| `c64be9dd` epilogue slices under `swiglu` | **not carried**; overlaps PR #108's GEMV-row `swiglu` / `rest` print (rule 24) — the merge keeps one print and re-checks the GEMV row's `rest` on the next profile | — |
| `3006d255` FC profile row | not carried on `htp_moe` (the `htp_hadamard` side tree had it, #95) | — |

Everything else arrives with the merge: `d2f0bf47` (dense FFN through the
MoE kernel — 4 % PPL on the author's measure, must stay **off** by
default under gate (c)), `7f81560b` / `e699e1bd` (conv block as one call,
two IDL entries → skel + app rebuild, new md5s), `5731b6e5` (down matmul
one block behind, inside `hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c`'s HMX loop; off the GEMV
path at M=1, unmeasured there), `1f538c20` (qkv fusion, ARM side — #81 /
#82's input), `32b46e32` (`NNTR_PPL`, the accuracy column ⑨ wants),
`aa371dd2` (pooled FC epilogue, prefill FC calls only). `git merge-tree`
names conflicts in `hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c`, `htp_compute_ops.cpp`,
`moe_layer_host_check.c`, `run_host_checks.sh`, `nntr_hvx_mm_u8i4.c` —
**#117's feed (PR #118) touches the first two and the last**, so the
ordering is a user call (needs-user): PR #118 first and #120 rebases over
it (the supervisor's recommendation: the feed is measured, the sync is
not), or #120 first and the feed re-applies on the merged tree. #120's
acceptance (issue body) carries the device A/B (decode ≥ −2 % of A,
prefill ≥ −5 %, text identical, every default-on upstream knob named).
On our side this cycle: #117 filled twice (`6412bfc9`, unit
`R3CY10WM83Y`), feed-default flip in progress on PR #118; #114 closed;
`htp_moe` head `6952cb6f`.

**Cycle 16 (seen 2026-09-27): PR head unchanged at `4ae1ebd7` (updated
2026-09-23 02:14 UTC; `gh api repos/Seunghui98/nntrainer/commits?sha=claude/htp-lfm2-moe-ffn`
lists nothing newer). Nothing to decide upstream. On our side: **#120
measured** (`120-upstream-4327-sync.md` @ `7ded3ce9`, `R3CY10WM83Y`,
2026-09-23 17:55–18:08, → §2 ㉔): the merge passes its gate (decode +4.7 /
+0.9 / −0.2 %, prefill **+12.4 / +10.2 / +6.2 %**, text = A 14/14,
`MoeLayerM1GemvMatchesHmx` bit-identical on B's skel), and its A — the
feed default with nothing set — is the new "now" (35.97 / 35.96 / 35.17,
BENCHMARK.md). **PR #121 is not merged**: after its rebase onto
`d79c0efe` it conflicts again with `htp_moe` @ `b4c96bdb` (PR #119, the
per-token entry). **User decision 2026-09-27 (contract §12): resolve as a
rebase onto `htp_moe`, rungs 0–1 only, no new sitting** — PR #119's
`NNTR_HTP_FORWARD=1` entry is off by default, so the measured B binary's
default path is unchanged by the rebase; the #120 sitting stands as the
PR's device evidence. The rebased PR states that rungs 2–3 were not run
(contract §4.1a; the workstation produces the skel/app md5s before any
later handoff). The "frozen at head `2ce38d65`" line above becomes
`4ae1ebd7` when PR #121 merges. #85 closed (PR #119 merged `b4c96bdb`);
`htp_moe` head `b4c96bdb`; PR #124 (Mac dev container, tooling) open.
**Queue (user, 2026-09-27; no device sitting possible for now, so only
issues that end in host-gated PRs): (1) PR #121 rebase (#120), (2) #82,

**Cycle 16b (post-merge fold, seen 2026-09-27 ~12:00 UTC): PR head
unchanged at `4ae1ebd7` (updated 2026-09-23 02:14 UTC; the branch's last
ten commits end at `4ae1ebd7`). Nothing to decide upstream. On our side
the user merged the whole cycle-16 queue into `htp_moe` in order,
11:30–11:32 UTC: PR #124 (`a875c085`, Mac dev container, §4.1a), PR #121

The "synced to `4ae1ebd7`" line above is the record; #82's `hvx_conv_gate_f32`

**Cycle 18 (seen 2026-09-28, the first sitting after the weekend's Mac
cycles): PR head unchanged at `4ae1ebd7` (updated 2026-09-23 02:14 UTC;
`gh pr view 4327` and the branch's last fifteen commits end there).
Nothing to decide upstream. On our side: `htp_moe` @ `39af2f39` (=
origin; cycle-16b fold `dbaf24b5` + plan 130), no filled handoff since
#120, no open PR into `htp_moe`, no `state:measured` issue. Consistency
check of the weekend's merges: #120 / #82 / #81 / #84 / #89 / #85 are
closed against PRs #121 / #125 / #126 / #127 / #128 / #119, and the tree
carries what plan 130 assumes (`hvx/hvx_m1_ops_f32`, `hvx_attn_m1_f32`,
`hvx_conv_gate_f32`, `m1_ops_det.h`, `attn_m1_det.h`, the `attn_m1_*` IDL
entries, `run_inproc_e2e.sh`, `htp_dump_eval.py`; `hexkl_graph.c`'s table
still MOE-only). Two things were stale and are fixed: the tracker #76 body
(cycle-12 text: "frozen at `2ce38d65`", provisional "now") is rewritten to
the merged state, and ten closed issues still carried a `state:*` label
(#117 #105 #102 #101 #100 #87 #85 `review`, #78 `in-progress`, #91 #114
`needs-plan`) — removed. Ruling recorded on #76: **#122 (docs/htp tech
docs, `state:in-progress`, user-driven sessions) is a docs track and does
not occupy the implementer's single `in-progress` slot**, so #130 may go
`in-progress` beside it. Local housekeeping left to the user / orchestrator
(not an agent output): worktrees of merged branches (`~/nntrainer-120`,
`-85`, `-guide`, `-moe` = `htp_moe_cycle` @ `d79c0efe`, `-A` detached)
and their `[gone]` local branches; `~/nntrainer-122` at `7d14d9fa` is three
commits behind `origin/htp/122-tech-docs` (`4c73bb01`). Rungs 2–3 md5s
for a post-#121 skel are still unrecorded (§3a); #130's gate produces
them. Queue: #130 planned p1, #99 / #90 planned p2, #110 parked — no new
issue.**

Host: 32.36 dB vs 32.39 for f32, 0.83 % one-step disagreements with the f32 grid, kernel bit-identical to its reference. **Off by default; "the f32-only tail path is a compile error in this build"** |

Reading: nothing on the decode path — at M=1 the GEMV path bypasses the
HMX block loop and its epilogue (`blocks=0 m1_gemv=1408/1408`), and the
knob is off. It touches the same requant site as #110 (⑱, parked) and
the `moe_layer_host_check.c` / `run_host_checks.sh` that every PR here
runs, so a merge would rebase over PR #133's host-check edits. No reason
to merge now: the author's own device gate is pending and the build is
scalar by design. On our side: **#130 measured and closed** (§2, ㉕–㉗,
rules 36–38), **#135** (user-filed: the Android app has no
`ENABLE_HEXKL`, rule 36), **#136** (B's text, p1) and **#137** (gtest
ulp / `AEE_ERPC`, p2) filed; queue for the planner **#135 → #136 →

no new commit; the three commits above stay unmerged — user decision). On
our side: **#135 closed** (PR #139 merged `02d96eb3`: `jni/meson.build`
exports `-DENABLE_HEXKL=1` through the prebuilt `Android.mk`,

Reading: still nothing on the decode path — the integer epilogue is the
M>1 HMX gate_up epilogue, which the M=1 GEMV path bypasses
(`blocks=0 m1_gemv=1408/1408`), and it stays behind a build define, off
by default. As a default it would fail our prefill gate (MoE prefill
call +35 % by the author's own number) while its only gain is an
f32-free grid of the same accuracy class. A merge now costs a skel + app
rebuild pair (IDL +13, rule 3) and a rebase over our IDL / `build.sh` /
`test/jni/Android.mk` edits (#130, #132 PR 1) for no decode change.
**Supervisor's recommendation: do not merge now; revisit when the
author's named trim brings the prefill call back to f32 ± 5 % or when a
sync is needed for another reason.** User decision.

decision (the 2026-09-28 hold covers `bcfc1ac5`; these three sit on
top of it). Oldest first:**

| sha | subject | touches |
|---|---|---|
| `b79c169f` | [HTP] Integer epilogue: the requant reads the mantissas once, the bake moves to upload | the gate_up worker leaves each (row, batch)'s min / max beside its exponent (`hvx_int_hmeta`), so the requant skips its rescan — same bytes; the per-column fixed-point bake moves from a layer's first call (2.9 ms) to weight-slot fill (`hexkl_mm_u8i4_dma.c`) |
| `28b456de` | [HTP] Integer requant: no clamp before the saturating packs, no shift for the coarsest batch | requant quantize-pass trim, same bytes; records the MoE prefill call 19.3 → 15.2 ms (f32 path 14.3) |
| `70655c4b` | [Docs] 53 9.13: the requant trim measured, the integer epilogue closed at f32 speed within noise | doc 53: requant exposure 560 → 457 µs (MoE rows), call host time within ≈ 0.4 ms of f32 (single-run noise ≈ 0.4 ms), PPL 60.9269 unchanged; "kept for its 1.2 ppl, not for speed"; the section closes |

Reading: still nothing on the decode path (M>1 HMX gate_up epilogue,
behind a build define, off by default; the M=1 GEMV bypasses it). The
cycle-20 condition for revisiting — the author's trim bringing the MoE
prefill call to f32 ± 5 % — is met by the author's own numbers
(≈ 14.7 vs 14.3 ms, ≈ +3 %), so the hold's performance objection is gone.
What remains against a merge now: it adds no decode speed, it is off by
default (so merged it changes no bit of our runs), and it costs a skel +
app rebuild pair (IDL +13 from `bcfc1ac5`, rule 3) plus a rebase over
PR #151's `htp_compute_ops.cpp` / skel / `build.sh` edits. As a
**default** it would change the prefill's u8 grid, which the 2026-09-28
bit-preserving rule excludes. **Supervisor's recommendation: keep holding;
merge only when a sync is needed for another reason.** User decision.

(user, 2026-09-30 / 10-01): agents run adb on `htp_decode` (`dc1898239`);
the S25 is withdrawn, the S26 (v81) replaces it (plan 201 §4.1

**Cycle 28 (2026-10-01, base `htp_decode` @ `84142c0b9`): the #208 S26
sitting happened, on a developer unit — recorded, not derived from.**
The orchestrator ran plan 204 §4 step 7 (G4 / G5 / G6) on
**`R3CY70LV96T`** (SM-S948U, SM8850, userdebug `S948USQU1AZAB`, kernel
6.12 — not the earlier S26 `R5KL20NFRCK`), 14:12–15:29 KST, three
invocations: attempt 1 ended when the `HmxMmU8I4Layer.RegistryCapacity`
gtest dropped the phone into download mode (rule 60), attempt 2 ran the
gtests with it excluded (mm_u8i4 34/0, fc 1/0, two_sessions 6/0,
softmax 28/4 and attn 10/2 = #137's known set, reproduced on v81) and
stopped on a config file the crash had zeroed, attempt 3 ran all 24 runs
+ 2 profiles + the CPU control without a stop. **What it showed: the
one-PD E2E (Q28) runs on an S26 (v81); every NPU text == A q4 r1 of its
G (20 / 20); the S1 ceiling stayed 3840 MiB throughout.** The raw tables
(A 53.6–57.9 and E0 29.3–33.9 at G 64, Q28 37.4 at G 512; four DMA

is derived from them, and ㉜ is not updated from them. **S26
optimization is deferred by the user until a product unit is

**Cycle 29 (2026-10-01 evening, base `htp_decode` @ `87cc9c4a4`): the

Q28 / Q24 G = 64 runs, every text == sitting 1's `A_G64_r1` 20 / 20,
ceiling 3840 after every run). **The orchestrator's first reading —
"reader-core placement decides the miss cost" (Q28_BIG 0.48 ms against
Q28 4.76) — was wrong**: the implementer's interleaved D / B / P0 × 4
sitting after a reboot read the big-core pin as slow as the default on
the first runs and all three settings equal from run 5 on; the readers do
not run in decode at all (code read). What is left: the slow miss (3.7–5.0
ms) is a **boot-proximity** effect (uptime ≲ 130 s in both sittings), the
cause unmeasured; rule 61 (wait ≥ 5 min or a warm-up after a reboot;
first-run cells flagged, #208's 4.7 ms a candidate), ㉜ rewritten, no
tok/s row (profiled runs). The S3 "reader cores" lever of plan 201 is not
applied (no code, no PR). Issues: #201 carried `state:in-progress` and
`state:review` at once → `state:in-progress` only (S4 slices PRs #213 /
#214 open, more remain); **the miss-cost cause filed as #216** (p1,
`state:needs-plan`); #137 stays `needs-plan`
p2 (device-gtest hygiene, reproduced on v81 in #208, not on the decode
goal path; PR #212 drops the one test that bricks the developer S26,

cache + Android (≈ 3.7 GB) exceed the 11.1 GB, so kswapd evicts the

**Cycle 31 (2026-10-02, base `htp_decode` @ `b26c161eb`): no measurement,
no row of record moves; three merges folded.** Merged by the user: PR
#214 (#201 S4: QK_NORM 256 / 512 + v norm, dense GeGLU, two-branch FFN +
`layer_scalar`, soft-capped 262 144-row head, `2b8832a23`), PR #212 (drop
`HmxMmU8I4Layer.RegistryCapacity`, the gtest that puts the S26 into
download mode, rule 60, `0e880088d`) and PR #217 (#216 step 1 docs,
`216-miss-read.md`, `b26c161eb`). With #214 every S4 kernel is in
(#209 GeGLU epilogue, #210 router / any-width norm, #213 attention, #214
head / norms / FFN); what remains of S4 is the Gemma graph builder and the
load hand-over (plan 201 §2.4 last row), host-gated on the #4296 tiny
fixture; S5 / S6 wait for the Gemma model files (and the user's pin of
upstream #4296, plan 201 §0). Open PRs into `htp_decode`: #218 (#216's
fadvise lever, env-only — the user's call stands from cycle 30: merge
env-only or close; the default flip is not recommended) and #220 (guide
refresh, docs, cycles 22–30). No `state:measured` issue, no device
attached (contract §12), upstream not watched. Queue healthy: #219
`state:planned` (plan `a540b876e`) and #137 `state:planned` — nothing
derived. Issue state: #216 `state:review` (unchanged), #201
`state:in-progress`, tracker #76's body rewritten for `htp_decode` (it had
stopped at 2026-09-30 on `htp_moe`: #132 Part B, the v81 issues and #157
/ #178 are closed since).

**Cycle 32 (2026-10-02, base `htp_decode` @ `238a280b7`): no measurement,
no row of record moves; one merge, three user decisions.** Merged by the
user: PR #218 (#216's `NNTR_MOE_FADVISE` lever, `238a280b7`) **env-only,
default not flipped** (user decision on the PR and on #216: the steady
0.86–1.13 ms miss and +10 / +15 % decode at G = 64 do not buy prefill
−7 to −18 %, rule 62); #216 closed `completed`, its `pgpgin_mib=` field
stays on every future pool-miss cell. Decisions recorded in the contract
(§12, two 2026-10-02 rows; §4.1 adb row; §4.2 device scope): (1) **the
LFM2.5 table is closed out on the #222 config of record** (all engine keys
`htp`, `init_seq_len 1024`, PPL cost of `attn_proj` / `dense_ffn`
accepted) and then the project moves to Gemma — the closing sitting
`222-config-refresh.md` (PR #223, open) is being run by the user on the
S25 via the farm; #222 stays `state:needs-measurement` and nothing of it
is folded before the handoff is filled and PR #223 merges; (2) **Gemma
(#201 S5 / S6) sittings run on a Galaxy S26 Ultra attached to the
workstation via adb**, a new BENCHMARK column; who drives that adb (agent
or user) is a `needs-user` question — until answered, agents do not run
adb. #201: PR #221 (S4 graph builder, 542-op 26B-A4B list, four mutants
caught) open; the rest of S4 waits on the user's three answers of the
2026-10-02 comment (#4296 pin merge, Gemma HTP MoE layer + QS4CX_WH
writer S5 → S4, head_dim ≥ 64 fixture). #219 `state:in-progress`

**Cycle 33 (2026-10-06, base `htp_first_version` @ `7f95140ad`): the #222
closing sitting is read as a verdict (no row of record, rule 63); one base
again; #225 PR 1 merged; six user decisions.** **Base.** The user
fast-forwarded `htp_first_version` to `htp_decode` @ `c7ec6c64a`, then
merged PR #223 (`b7c1d4ff6`) and PR #230 (`7f95140ad`) into it: from this
cycle `htp_first_version` is the only base (contract §5) and the
supervisor's docs live there. `htp_decode` is behind it and receives
nothing new; the PRs still open against it — #226 / #227 / #231 (#201 S4,
stacked), #224 (#219), #220 (guide) — need retargeting, a user step. The
first cycle-33 docs commit (`0e89e600b`, written on `htp_decode` before
the fast-forward) was **dropped by the merge of PR #223**, which took the
branch side of BENCHMARK / LEDGER / contract; its content (this paragraph's
#222 part, rule 63, the §2 #222 row, BENCHMARK's Method paragraph and Log
row, the contract's §4.1 / §4.2 / §5 / §12 hunks) is restored here. **(1)
#222's closing sitting** (2026-10-02 16:15–16:54 KST, farm `R3CY205ZMND`,
S25 v79, set from `ddb7d9ad8`; results only in #222's comments of 08:00 /

merged **unfilled**, no device md5 line reached the supervisor, so nothing
is a row of record and no BENCHMARK Results row is added): **Qnew (one PD,

G1024 = `max_seq_len` 2048 generated to the end). Rule 63 and the §2 #222
row carry the verdict; the accuracy fail is the next issue per the
contract — **#225** (p0, filed by the user), the Qnew C = 24 follow-up is
**cancelled** (user: the fix changes the FC format, the reading would not
carry), #222 closed `completed` on PR #223's merge. **(2) The LFM2.5 table

for CPU only, hybrid and E2E one PD, on the config of record with
`init_seq_len 1024` (user) — filled by #225's handoff (step 7 of plan 225).
**(3) #225 (`state:in-progress` + `needs-user`, p0): option (b) as a
sidecar.** The FC weights are quantized once from f32 by the packer into
`QS4CX_WH` images in a sidecar `<main>_fcwh.bin` (user: sidecar, not a

228,188,160 B, md5 `71812a91…`, written in the same packer run as the main

Artifacts). **PR 1 = #230 merged `7f95140ad`**: `--fc_wh_sidecar` in
`nntr_quantize_stream`; the loader preads the images into the arena (no
requant, no heap copy; a bit-exact unpack to the heap only on overflow); the
conv block / dense FFN / MoE prefill calls run in 512-row chunks with the
conv history carried in `conv_w` (no IDL change) — **the user made PR 1's
512-token chunking the hybrid's way of record, not a stopgap**. Host:

bit_identical=1`, `CONV BLOCK CHUNKED BIT-IDENTICAL`, `E2E keys lfm25-p2x
prompt=1024 … bit_identical=1`; skels v79 + v81; no device run (the device
gets PR 1 only with PR 2, plan 225 §3.4). PR 2 (E2E FC / DENSE_FFN on the
WH GEMV with the VTCM feed, `htp/225-fcwh-e2e`) is being built; **PR 3
(user request) = the hybrid's M = 1 FCs on the WH GEMV behind
`NNTR_HTP_FC_M1`, default off, a reading beside B in the handoff**, with
rule 40 / 42 / 49 caveats on record. Still `needs-user` before the handoff:
the accuracy threshold (T1 contract §1 ≤ 1.02 × the no-keys hybrid vs T2
rule 45 — deferred by the user) and the hybrid overflow fallback (pool
C = 31 vs the attention / dense keys off at prefill). **(4) Devices:**
LFM2.5 on the S25 via the farm, run by the user; Gemma on the S26 Ultra
attached to the workstation, **the agent drives adb** (user; the
2026-10-01 rule set applies to that unit). **(5) #201**

is attached to the workstation; the agent drives its adb for the Gemma
sittings (the 2026-10-06 rule set); `/data` has 26 GB free — a 4-bit
26B-A4B model fits once; the files themselves are still not on the
workstation (S5 blocked on them: #201 gets `needs-user`, stays
`state:in-progress`). (3) **#229** (p1, `state:needs-plan`, in this
project's queue from today): the real Gemma 4 checkpoint carries
**ternary** weights; a ternary → 4-bit dequantization will be added so
prefill and decode use the existing 4-bit kernels; the planner reviews
the decode gain of a LUT dequantization (T-MAN `hvx_lut_ctor` / `hvx_tbl`
/ `hvx_bit_serial`, `docs/htp_moe/t-man-lut-reference.md`) — options A
(4-bit in DDR, today's path), B (ternary in DDR, unpacked per tile into
VTCM, DDR bytes ÷ ≈ 2–2.5) and C (the LUT GEMV on ternary, own SNR gate);
ternary → 4-bit is exact, so A / B keep the CPU bit-identity. **#225:**

invocation, no STOP, zone0 ≤ 35 °C at every block start. **md5:** the set
was rebuilt on the measuring workstation from `51b2b4477` (code
`7efd22adf`; `md5.txt` `23000b96…`, not the staged `dd24b4fc…`), device
md5 == that set, the sidecar re-packed from fp32 byte-identical
(`71812a91…`) and the main bin unchanged (`7b7867fa…`) — the rule-14 /
rule-22 case, accepted as the device set (BENCHMARK Artifacts); it
started 52 s after the reboot, not after 5 min idle (rule 61), which the
Q G64 r1 cells show (P64 42.81 vs r2 49.31). **Verdicts per gate (§2

(`prefillRows()`, `htp_compute_ops.cpp:5426`) covers the conv block, the
dense FFN and the MoE prefill calls, while the FC paths
(`gemm_q4_0_accel_fp32` / `gemm_q4_0_batch_fp32`, `:1262–1345`) chunk by
`fcMaxRows(K)` = 1920 rows at K = 2048, so the M = 1024 qkv call reaches
the DSP whole; the same call succeeds on Q (heap 0) and fails on B with
the FC overflow (`heap_kib=75776`) on the heap — **rule 64**, open item
㊱, filed as **#236** (p1, `state:needs-plan`); Bfb's
numbers are the hybrid's P1024 cells of record (52.03 / 51.51 / 48.74
vs the CPU 47.58 / 48.82 / 47.41). G4 accuracy, **T2** (user): PPL

P1024 G512, Q P1024 G512**; B P64 G64 degenerates where A loops too
(the P64 prompt asks to continue without stopping); Q P512 G64 echoes the
prompt's instruction; **the approval column is empty — the user's**, so
no cell is folded as a row of record (the contract's accuracy gate, as
amended 2026-09-28). **Speed, inside the sitting:** hybrid B at P512

G = 64 on top of rule 41's 14.7 → the 22 × 0.395 = 8.7 ms `dsp`). **The
"now" row does not move** (BENCHMARK Method, cycle-34 paragraph): the
hybrid of record is a new config, not bit-identical, on an open PR, on
a different unit, with its texts unapproved; by the user's 2026-10-06
decision the 9 × 3 table becomes the LFM2.5 row of record once the
texts are approved and PR #233 is merged. **Runner artifact** (open item
㊲): `[HTP] dspq: on queue=0x…` / `graph: init …` print inside the
generated text (stdout not line-terminated), so `225-run.sh`'s own
`speed.txt` reads DIFF for every NPU run and its one `BAD` (`every r2
text == its r1: got 2`) is the queue address, not nondeterminism; with
the banners removed every r2 text equals its r1; `gen()` must strip
`\[HTP[^\n]*\n` anywhere — a docs-only fix on PR #233's branch, filed as
a comment on #225. **Issue states:** #225 `state:measured` →
`state:review` + `needs-user` (PR #233 complete; the user merges it and
approves the texts); the qkv chunk defect is **#236**; #219's PR
#224 is merged into the base (`9f33d7d43`, another session) — its
step-4 sitting (`219-arm-tier.md`) is now runnable once PR #233 is in,
since the one PD loads on the config of record with the sidecar.
**Base note:** PRs #226 / #227 / #231 / #220 were **merged into
`htp_decode`** (not retargeted) by another session on 2026-10-06, and
#234 (p1, `state:needs-plan`, another session) states "`htp_decode`
stays the Gemma base" and tracks upstream nntrainer/nntrainer#4408
(Seunghui98's Gemma-4 26B HTP draft) — this contradicts the contract's
§5 single-base row of the morning; the supervisor's docs stay on
`htp_first_version` as told, the reconciliation is the user's. #229
(another session's) untouched. Queue: #234 and #110 `state:needs-plan`,
#137 and #229 `state:planned`, #236 `needs-plan` — healthy,
nothing else derived. Upstream #4327 not watched. Tracker #76 body
refreshed (the #225 / #219 / open-PR paragraphs).

**Cycle 35 (2026-10-06, base `htp_decode` @ `a19d4dd4e`): the goal is
restated; no measurement, no row, no `state:measured` handoff folded.**
Merged by the user: PR #235 (guide, cycles 31–34, `a19d4dd4e`) into
`htp_decode`; PR #224 (#219's ARM tier, host-gated) into
`htp_first_version` — #219 stays `state:needs-measurement`, its step-4
sitting waits on #225 (one PD does not load on the config of record
without the FC WH sidecar). **User decisions (contract §1 / §12):** (1)
the project goal is now **Gemma-4 26B-A4B with ternary-quantized weight
files on the NPU, decode end to end on the one-PD path; no tok/s target**
(50 tok/s is a reference). Ternary is confirmed, the storage format is
still to come (#229 S0 `needs-user`); #229 S1 (port #4410's `QS2CX_WH` +
u8i2 GEMV onto the pool path, host-gated on the hd64 fixture) starts
without it. (2) A **peak-memory bound < 2 GB** (process RSS incl. ION
arenas, flash streaming for the rest) was stated and the same day
**deferred to a later stage — after the ternary 26B decodes end to end on
the device, not a gate on S5 / S6**; ㉟ holds it. (3) **`htp_decode` stays
the Gemma base**; §Upstream gains the #4408 watch (`28771a928`) and the
`htp_first_version` watch; #234 (p1, `state:needs-plan`, planner this
cycle) ports #4408's converter / safetensors reader / 26B config and
#225's FC WH path; the `06ed17b7b` "single base" docs rewrite is not
carried (closes cycle 34's docs-base question: the supervisor's docs live
on `htp_decode`). **#225** (`state:measured` + `needs-user`,
`htp_first_version`, another session): `origin/htp_first_version` carries
no `docs/measurements/225-*` since `06ed17b7b` (only the #219 handoff
files, unfilled) — nothing to fold; the `state:measured` label is that
session's and is left alone. Queue: #234 `needs-plan`, #229 + #137
`planned`, #110 `needs-plan` — healthy, nothing derived. Open PRs: #233
(`htp_first_version`). S26 column still empty (no files). "Now" unchanged
(LFM record sitting 53.97 / 52.16 / 51.41; S25 column frozen). Tracker
#76 retitled to the Gemma goal, body refreshed.

**2026-10-06 sync: the user's standing decision is the single base `htp_first_version`; htp_decode's Gemma work is merged here by this sync.** `origin/htp_decode` (cycles 33–35 above, the #201 S4
Gemma stack PRs #226 / #227 / #231 / #232, guide #220, plan 229) is
merged into `htp_first_version`. Both branches' cycle-33 and cycle-34
paragraphs are kept as written, in cycle order; their two base
statements ("single base `htp_first_version`" / "`htp_decode` stays
the Gemma base", #234) stay verbatim and this line is the reading of
record. Open items: `htp_decode`'s ㉞ / ㉟ keep their numbers;
`htp_first_version`'s cycle-34 ㉞ (#236) and ㉟ (runner banners) are
renumbered ㊱ / ㊲ in this copy (§3), with their references.

**Cycle 35b (2026-10-06 evening, base `htp_first_version` @ `78dace26f`,

**Double fold, to reconcile at the next sync:** cycle 36 on
`origin/htp_decode` (`9c92d0ac8`, 10:20 UTC, one minute before this
fold) folded the same handoff with the same reading — its rule 65 (one
thread stores faster than eight), its ㉜ update, §2 #219 row, two Results
rows + an Artifacts row + a Method paragraph on that copy; its ㊳ is #229
S1's "no device reading" item (that is why this copy's #219 remainder is
㊴), its rule 66 is #229 S1's mask finding. One difference of verdict:
that fold set #219 `state:in-progress` (the implementer continues on the
G2 remainder — refill ordering / two refill threads); this one set
`state:review` (PR #224 merged, the measured change is complete; the
remainder is a second decidable change, ㊴, to be filed once the default
is decided). The label stands at `state:review` + `needs-user` as of
10:22 UTC; **which it should be is the user's / orchestrator's call**,
and the sync that carries `9c92d0ac8` here should keep one copy of rule
65 and of the #219 rows (the facts agree).

**LFM2.5 status (close-out, cycle 36).** *Met and of record:* decode
≥ 50 tok/s at G 64 / 512 / 1024 above the CPU on the old config (record
sitting 2026-09-30, bit-identical levers, text ≡ A); the 9 × 3 × 3 table
on the config of record (`init_seq_len 1024`, all engine keys `htp`, FC
WH sidecar, hybrid prefill in 512-token chunks, `NNTR_MOE_TIER=2` E2E
default): CPU #225 A, hybrid #225 B / #236 B (P1024), E2E #219t — the
hybrid above the CPU at 9 / 9 and ≥ 50 at 8 / 9, the E2E above at 6 / 9
(G ≥ 512) and under at G64 — as speed readings until the user approves
the texts. *On hold (user 2026-10-06; not pursued on LFM, not handed to
Gemma):* the FC quantization accuracy problem — the config-of-record
texts loop at P1024 / G ≥ 512 where the CPU does not, prefill PPL +4 %
and decode PPL +7–10 % over the keys-off model (#225 texts n). *Closed by
decision:* the E2E decode speed gap on LFM2.5 (re-examined on Gemma);
#225's PR 3 (`NNTR_HTP_FC_M1`) unless the user says otherwise. **What
stays open and is Gemma's to pick up** (each with the LFM reading it
starts from): (a) **accuracy / quantization** — an int4 FC set that
passes an SNR gate yet loops in free-running text: Gemma's gate is 20 dB
SNR + tokens vs the CPU, and the LFM T2 reading says the free-running
text must be read beside it (rules 39 / 45); (b) **E2E G64 vs the
hybrid** — the one-PD path is 3–8 % under the CPU and 8–15 % under the
hybrid at G64 at every P because the residual scales with P (rule 67):
misses/token × the copy plus a ≈ 45–160 ms decode-start cost a run; the
levers are to drain the refill backlog before the first decode token
(㊴ 2) and a pool that survives the prefill batch; (c) **`tier_waits`
3–4 a run / `pswpin` ≠ 0** (㊴ 2–3, rule 65 b / c) — hygiene on the same
path Gemma's one PD uses; (d) **skip loading the ARM Q4_0 FC set
(≈ 170 MiB) on the E2E path** — the one PD never reads it (`cpu fc
skipped` = 32 × tokens, #225), it only costs RSS and load time; Gemma's
2 GB stage (㉟) is where it pays. Also carried: rule 66 (stale skel after
an IDL change) and rule 68 (prefill FC chunking) apply to every Gemma
sitting; the LFM2.5 device rules 61 / 65 hold for the S25 only until the
S26 re-reads them.

## 1. Rules (device disagreed with reasoning; do not re-derive)

Inherited from the PR's device work, with their sources:

1. **A `--profile` build is never the tok/s binary** — it inflates prefill
   by 83 % (doc 46 §43.4).
2. **Read `min`, not `avg`** — profile averages include the first

3. **Rebuild the skel whenever the IDL or DSP sources change**;
   `build_android.sh` never does. Symptom of a stale skel:
   `AEE_EBADPARM (0x8000040E)` (doc 46 §48.7).
4. **`build_android.sh --clean` drops `-Denable-htp` silently**; check
   `readelf -d libnntrainer.so` for `libsdkl.so` (mobile guide §4).
5. **Never push the link-time stub `libcdsprpc.so`** to the phone (mobile
   guide §5).
6. **`QS4CX_WH` has no CPU fallback**; a wrong layout gives plausible wrong
   text, not an error; `moe_htp_layers` must be empty (doc 46 §35, §48.7).
7. **Moving a matmul to the HTP does not pay when the round trip exceeds
   the matmul** — conv in_proj: −13 ms of an expected −65..−100 (doc 50
   §3.4); the same rule closed doc 45 §0.
8. **The DSP address space, not host RAM, bounds registration**: 3840 MiB
   arena + ≈ 182 MiB heap in one 4 GiB space; 256 MiB chunks avoid the
   alignment waste that made it look like a 3 GiB limit (doc 46 §39–§41).
9. **Decode drifts between sittings without a code cause** (20.8 → 16.5,
   doc 50 §3.4; ±5 % in `hvx_impl` #53): every sitting starts with the
   control binary, and results are read as A/B inside the sitting.
10. **Cross-session decode numbers from another unit are provisional**
    (two S25 Ultra units: 6–8.6 % apart on one binary, `hvx_impl` #23/#53).

11. **AMENDED by rule 28 (#100, 2026-09-23): the "4–7×" is a ratio against
    a probe number no tag-validated per-call path reproduces.** The
    in-situ 16–18 GB/s is real; the 72–117 GB/s denominator is not a
    ceiling. Read this rule as its surviving half — *wall 2 is decided
    only by instrumentation inside the layer call, never by a probe* —
    and take the validated ceiling from `c_star` (26.3 GB/s), against
    which the in-situ list is **faster**, not 2.7× slower. Original text:
    **Isolated DMA probes overstate the in-situ rate by 4–7×.** The same
    engine on the same arena and skel: 72–80 GB/s contiguous, 108–117
    GB/s strided 2D in a probe; **16.2–18.0 GB/s** in the MoE layer call's
    `weight DMA` line of the same sitting (the PR author's 38 GB/s probe
    sat in between). Workers 1 → 4 are flat to negative, the bus vote is
    ≤ 4 % (noise). Wall 2 is therefore decided only by instrumentation
    *inside* the layer call (#87), never by a probe.
12. **A DSP-side bandwidth loop must defeat VTCM/L2 residency or it
    measures nothing**: the two-reader probe's `dsp_alone` read 3265 GB/s.
    Bound the result inside the test (≤ 150 GB/s or `INVALID`) (#90).
13. **Any unit; only a same-sitting A/B is a verdict** (user decision
    2026-09-22, contract §12; supersedes the earlier "unit `R3CY10WM83Y`
    is the anchor" form of this rule). Handoffs name no serial; the
    filled handoff records the serial that ran; every BENCHMARK row is
    unit-tagged; cross-sitting numbers are compared only as same-unit
    drift when the unit happens to be the same (rule 9). The second-unit
    anchor and the per-cell unit ratio (#91, ⑮) are withdrawn as goals.
    Two S25 Ultra units were 6–8.6 % apart in `hvx_impl`; that fact stays
    as the reason for the rule.
14. **Compiled artifacts are not byte-reproducible across build paths.**
    #77's skel, app and gtest md5s all differed from the table after a
    rebuild of identical sources under another path, while every
    non-compiled file and both model `.bin`s matched bit-for-bit. A
    handoff's md5 table is filled from the build that is pushed, or the
    device `md5sum` lines are recorded against the commit; a mismatch
    with that provenance intact is a note, not a void, in a control-only
    sitting — with a B variant it stays a void.
15. **`NNTR_HTP_PROFILE=3` inflates `[M0-PROF] ffn=` ~5×** (16–20 ms →
    88–90 ms per MoE layer): only the `[HTP-PROFILE]` `transport` /
    `host` / `dsp` columns are comparable across levels 2 and 3.
16. **The `generation(last 64)` line lives in the base report block or
    not at all**: `Lfm2MoeCausalLM` reports from `causal_lm.cpp:699`, not
    from `lfm2_causallm.cpp`'s block (#89).

17. **Gate 2 must include an undefined-symbol check of the skel.**
    `-Wall -Werror` clean is not "links": a Hexagon shared object links
    with unresolved symbols by default, and the device loader then fails
    `dlopen` with `0x80000406` / `dlerror RX VA 0xFFF00000 outside ELF
    segment` — a message that reads like a segment-layout bug and is not
    one. #94's skel from `2a75f7d9` had seven `U hexkl_dma_trace_*`
    (`hexkl_dma_trace.c` from PR #93 never entered `test/htp/build.sh`
    `SRCS`; the host check compiled it on its own, so gate 1 passed).
    From now on gate 2 = `-Wall -Werror` **and** `hexagon-nm -u -D
    build/libnntr_hvx_skel.so` shows no `U` outside the runtime set
    (`HAP_*`, `compute_resource_*`, `qurt*`, libc, compiler-rt); #97 puts
    that check (or `-Wl,--no-undefined`) into `build.sh`. Second artifact
    found broken only on the device (rule 14 was the first): every new
    `.c` under `htp_backend/` is checked against `build.sh` at review.
    Distinguish the three loader errors: `0x8000040E` = stale skel vs IDL
    (rule 3), `htp Context is not registered` = app-side, `0x80000406` =
    the skel itself does not load.

18. **The isolated probe rate drifts 3–19 % with the phone's temperature
    inside one sitting** (`DMA_PROBE` shape iii, 1 worker: 106.9 GB/s at
    29 °C, 88.8 at ~51 °C) while the tok/s cells of the same sitting did
    not collapse (CPU 47–53). A probe reading is quoted with its
    `thermal_zone0`; the gap analysis uses the cool reading as the
    achievable ceiling and the hot one as the run of record.
19. **WITHDRAWN by rule 28 (#100, 2026-09-23).** The "2.7× lost in the
    list itself" was `traced` / `DMA_PROBE iii`; against the
    tag-validated `c_star` of the same log the traced list reads
    **1.19×**, i.e. faster than the ceiling. Row h dissolves and there is
    no list-side loss to fix. What survives: the *paced* replay
    reproduces the in-situ 15.6–18.6 GB/s (the interleaving is real,
    rows f + g), and more workers make the replay slower. Original text:
    **The real chunk list is slow on its own** (provisional on #99): the
    traced 46-descriptor / 32-region M=1 list replayed unpaced, one
    worker, no compute, no competitor runs at 40.2 GB/s where a probe of
    the identical 8 KiB × 64 @ 56 KiB shape does 106.9 on the same unit
    and skel; paced to the in-situ schedule it reproduces the in-situ
    15.6–18.6 GB/s. Rule 11's 4–7× therefore splits into ≈ 2.7× in the
    list itself and ≈ 1.3–1.8× in the interleaving (rows f + g ≈ 20 % of
    `dsp_us`). More workers make the replay slower (40.2 → 39.1 → 36.5).
20. **NPU tok/s drifts −7..−16 % day to day on one unit while the DSP
    profile columns move ≤ 4 %** (#94 s2 vs #77, same unit and forward
    path): the tok/s cells carry host and thermal state, the
    `[HTP-PROFILE]` `dsp=` / `mm` columns carry the kernel. Cross-sitting
    kernel claims are read from the profile columns, tok/s only inside a
    sitting.
21. **Rule 14, refined by the cycle-5 decision on #94 Deviation 5:** a
    device set whose md5s differ from the staged table but whose
    provenance is intact (commit + build line + `md5sum` recorded, DSP
    sources shown identical by `git diff`) is **accepted as the sitting's
    provenance** when every variant of the sitting is the same binary set
    switched by an environment variable or config key (A and C of #94).
    "Void once a B variant is included" applies only when a variant is a
    *different binary* whose staged md5 the device does not match. Also
    from that sitting: `test/htp/build.sh` picks the newest directory
    under `$HEXKL_ROOT/lib` when `HEXKL_SDK_VER` is unset — a workstation
    with 6.6.0.0 installed silently links another HexKL; every handoff's
    build line carries `HEXKL_SDK_VER=6.4.0.1`.

Learned in this project (#88, unit `R3CY205ZMND`, 2026-09-22):

22. **Handoff artifacts must be reproducible from the commit on any
    workstation; the staging path is not a deliverable.** Twice now (#94
    s2's skel, #88's whole A/B set) the sitting ran on a workstation where
    `/local/mnt/workspace/htp_moe/<n>/` and the implementer's worktrees did
    not exist, and the user rebuilt from the named commits. A handoff
    therefore carries, per variant: the commit, the exact build line
    (`build_android.sh --htp` then `--htp --cache`, `test/htp/build.sh`
    with `HEXKL_SDK_VER=6.4.0.1`, env var names, no absolute worktree
    paths), and the md5s of the non-compiled inputs (model, tokenizer,
    prompt, `libc++_shared.so`, `libsdkl.so`), which must match anywhere.
    **Rule 21 extended to binary B variants:** a sitting whose variants are
    *different binaries* rebuilt from their named commits is accepted
    when (a) every results row carries the device md5 of the binary that
    differs between variants, (b) the source diff between the variant
    commits is exactly the PR under test (`git diff A B -- nntrainer
    Applications test`), and (c) shared DSP artifacts are one file for
    all variants. It stays void when a device md5 matches neither the
    staged table nor a recorded rebuild. #88 met (a)–(c) (device
    `libnntrainer.so` `5db71a2e…` A / `3cf06450…` B in every row; diff
    `08afbb10..f3e99176` = `htp_backend/{htp_backend.cpp,
    htp_compute_ops.cpp, htp_rpcmem.h}` only; one skel `2bd7311f…`).
23. **The FastRPC `transport` column drifts across sittings like tok/s;
    only `dsp=` is a cross-sitting column.** Identical sources
    (`2a75f7d9` = `08afbb10` outside `build.sh`), same unit, same day,
    ≈ 2 h apart: #94 s2 A level 2 M==1 host / dsp / transport 2062.5 /
    1414.0 / 648.6 µs, #88 A 1812.1 / 1410.8 / 401.3 — dsp −0.2 %,
    transport −38 %. Rule 20 extends to `host` and `transport`: a
    transport claim is an A/B inside one sitting (as #88's was), never a
    comparison against an earlier sitting's row. Corollary for budgets:
    the time **outside** the MoE call (TPS token minus 22 × host) moved
    with the poll/staging variant too — 13.5 ms (A) / 11.4 (C) / 8.4 (B)
    at G=64 — so ≈ 5 of #88's 12.6 ms/token gain landed outside the
    call's own timer (candidates: the 5 ms poll keeps the calling core
    and its cluster clock up between calls; cache maintenance around the
    call; not decided).
24. **In an `m1_gemv=calls/calls` profile row, `swiglu` is Σ lane-time
    over the worker pool (6 lanes on v79), not a stage;** `swiglu / mm`
    is lane utilisation (#94 C: 5601.2 / 974.7 = 5.75). Since PR #108 the
    row's `rest` leaves it out and the `weight DMA: n/a` line prints the
    ratio; before that PR a GEMV row's `rest` is meaningless (#102).

24. **v79 HVX IEEE `sf` arithmetic keeps subnormals. It does not flush
    them to zero.** `HvxFwht.MatchesScalarBitExact` fed a row of ±1e-39 /
    ±1e-40 (all subnormal). The DSP (`Q6_Vsf_vadd/vsub_VsfVsf`, then
    `Q6_Vsf_vmpy_VsfVsf` by 1/16, `-mhvx-ieee-fp`) returned
    `0x1.7f4b4p-127` at index 1. That is exactly 8·(1e-39 + 1e-40), the
    unflushed IEEE result, and itself subnormal. The scalar spec
    (`fwht_det_ftz` on every input and result) returned `+0`. Only the two
    non-zero outputs of that row differed (`bad_gated = bad_subnormal_row
    = 2`). The spec's premise ("HVX sf flushes them") was host reasoning,
    and the device refutes it: this is not a flushed-zero *sign*. A `_det`
    scalar spec for HVX `sf` code is plain IEEE RNE with no FTZ, and the host
    side must not run under a flush either (`-ffast-math` /
    `crtfastmath` can set aarch64 FPCR.FZ). Fix carried by #110. The
    same test's overflow row (±3e38, `bad_overflow_row=127 of 256`) is
    ungated and not yet explained (inf/NaN encoding is the candidate).
25. **A synthetic single-shape gtest cannot give an accuracy verdict. It
    gates bit-exactness only.** `MoeLayerHadamardMatchesTwoCallReference`
    matched its two-call host reference bit for bit (`bad_elems=0 of
    409600`, `max_ulp=0`). It still failed its own SNR assertion: rotated
    17.51 dB vs unrotated 23.32 dB, −5.8 dB on its uniform synthetic input.
    The full model in the same sitting improved +8.0 dB median requant SNR
    over about 6.2 k real expert calls, and PPL dropped −12.7 %. The two
    disagree in sign. Accuracy verdicts come from the full-model columns
    (`NNTR_PPL`, `[L2-DIFF-MOE]` over a run, text vs A). A gtest prints
    its SNR as a field and asserts only the bit-identity to its scalar
    reference (gate (a)).

26. **At m = 1 the HVX GEMV over the arena is bound by DDR read latency,
    not by `vrmpy` issue. Cutting compute there makes it slower.** The plan
    expected that dropping `gemm_rows4`'s three dead accumulators would
    save 50–100 µs. On the device the one-row loop (B1) raised the M==1
    `mm` from 973.0 to 1044.6 µs (+7.4 %) and cut decode by 4–8 %. Under
    the same loop, the L2-hot microbench cell ran 2.26× faster (70.77 →
    31.25 ns/tile). With 2 `vrmpy` per quarter-tile instead of 8, fewer
    loads are in flight to cover the DDR latency. The `l2fetch` lead wins
    it back monotonically (0 / 64 / 192 KB: 145.2 / 137.5 / 120.2 ns/tile
    arena) but still does not beat the four-row loop's 111.7 at 192 KB.
    A compute-side change to the M=1 GEMV is read on the `hot` cell, or
    after the feed is in VTCM. On the arena it shows the latency, not the
    compute.
27. **ION arena and cached heap read alike from HVX (within 11 %, no
    consistent sign), 21–27 GB/s.** The ION mapping is not why the M=1
    GEMV feed is slow. That is the plain direct-vector DDR band `hvx_impl`
    #59 measured on a sibling SoC (21–25 GB/s vs 37 through the ring). Only
    a DMA feed into VTCM (#100 → ㉒) gets past it. Also from this sitting,
    confirming rule 20: two level-2 profile passes in opposite order, from
    30 °C and 50–58 °C starts, agreed ≤ 0.4 % on every `mm`. A's `mm`
    973.0 reproduces #94 s2 C's 974.7 on the same DSP path, while decode
    tok/s differs by +47 % (PR #103's transport). The `mm` / `dsp` columns
    carry the kernel; E2E prefill tok/s carries the position in the
    block (A's own pairs −10..−24 %).

28. **A `DMA_PROBE` number is not a ceiling; the tag-validated `c_star`
    is.** In one log, `c_star` (the per-call shape with its content
    checked, `checksum_ok=y`) reads **26.3 GB/s** = 0.36 × the same log's
    `DMA_PROBE shape=iii workers=1` (73.2). Against `c_star` the traced
    46-descriptor / 32-region M=1 list runs at **1.19 ×** — *faster* than
    the ceiling — and every other validated cell sits at 30–31.7 GB/s
    whatever the descriptor count (8 / 24 / 28 / 36 / 46), the chaining
    mode (`dmstart`, `link1`, chained) or `dst` (linear, strided). So the
    probe measures something the engine cannot deliver through a real
    per-call list, rules 11 and 19 are amended/withdrawn above, and row h
    of the wall-2 attribution dissolves. **Consequence for gates: an
    absolute GB/s target is only meaningful next to the same run's
    `c_star` and next to rule 30's anchor cell.**
29. **HVX streaming out of VTCM is nearly free beside a concurrent DMA
    into it**: `load=2` costs **0.1–0.3 %** against `load=0` on all three
    certified feed shapes (699.8 → 700.5, 695.5 → 697.6, 700.5 → 701.8
    µs/call). A VTCM feed's cost is therefore the DMA rate alone, and the
    "HVX and DMA fight over VTCM" worry is closed.
30. **One unit's DMA rate drifts ≈ 22 % between sittings on an untouched
    cell, and it is not thermal.** `DMA_REPLAY workers=1 load=0 pace=0`
    (identical code in both sittings) read 561.5 µs/call = 40.2 GB/s in
    #94 s2 and **719.6 µs = 31.4 GB/s** in #100 on the same unit; a
    cooled repeat at 31 800 m°C (vs 46 500) reproduces every #100 ratio
    within 1 %. One-worker probe rows are 15–30 % low while four-worker
    rows are within 6 %, so it bites **single-queue issue rate, not
    aggregate DDR bandwidth**. Cause not separated (session clock /
    governor vs a rebuilt skel). **Any handoff with an absolute GB/s gate
    carries that cell as its in-sitting anchor and reports the gate
    scaled by it.** **Resolved by #113 (rule 32): the drift is
    persistent, and 31–32 GB/s is the bound.**

31. **An `l2fetch` lead harms a loop that is not latency-starved; it
    helps only the loop that is, and only up to one L2 budget.** Rule 26
    read the other way round, now measured on the full 2 × 5 matrix. The
    four-row loop (8 `vrmpy` of loads in flight per quarter-tile) with
    *any* lead reads **2.1–2.5× slower** on the arena (`ns_per_tile`
    133.5 → 282.3 / 316.4 / 323.1 / 328.4 at 192 / 384 / 768 / 1536 KB),
    the damage starts at the first non-zero lead rather than at a
    capacity boundary, and the `hot` cell is flat (71.7–73.5) — the
    signature of **interference** (the box competes with the loop's own
    demand loads for L2 and bus), not of eviction. The one-row loop (2
    `vrmpy`) improves to a minimum at 192 KB (154.3 → 129.1) and degrades
    past it (`inflight_kb=384` × 6 lanes ≈ 2.25 MB, the L2 budget). In
    the layer call: four-row + 192 KB `mm` 1925.5 vs 1000.2 (+92.5 %),
    one-row + 192 KB **937.0 (−6.3 %)**, one-row + 384 KB 1042.8. The
    whole matrix is on the board; its minimum is one-row + 192 KB and no
    (loop, lead) pair reaches 840. Corollary: a prefetch knob is never
    added to a loop without its own `hot`-vs-`arena` cell, and the lead
    is read as an ordinal (the up half of stage A gets ≈ two
    column-computes of it, not the nominal KB — the fourth outstanding
    box is #114's).
32. **The ≈ 22 % DMA drift of rule 30 is persistent, not a session
    effect: 31–32 GB/s is this unit's real single-queue DMA bound.** The
    untouched anchor cell (`DMA_REPLAY workers=1 load=0 pace=0`, source
    unchanged since #94) read **724.0 µs / 31.2 GB/s** cold (27 900 m°C)
    in #113 — #100's 719.6 / 31.4 to within 0.6 %, not #94's 561.5 /
    40.2. Whatever made #94 s2 read 40.2 has not returned in two
    sittings; #100's `f2` feed cell (31.6 GB/s beside HVX) is therefore
    read at face value against a 31–32 GB/s ceiling, not scaled to 37.
    Consequence: **㉒'s feed half closes as a bandwidth question** — the
    DMA cannot deliver 37 GB/s per call on this unit — and re-opens only
    as a *rate* lever: 31.6 through VTCM vs the direct HVX arena read's
    21–27 (23.5 under the one-row loop + 192 KB lead) is ≈ 1.33×.
33. **Decision rule (user, 2026-09-23, "1번으로 진행", #76-level): a

    prefill gate holds; the issue's gate still says whether the issue
    is done.** #113's D192 missed `mm` ≤ 840 (937.0, +11.5 %) and lands

    the sitting's own A spread (rule 27), or one bought with a text
    change. The default flip is its own change with its own acceptance

    607.9 / 605.3 µs (37.1 / 37.3 GB/s) in two sittings on the second
    unit against 724.0 / 719.6 (31.2 / 31.4) on the first (rules 30, 32);
    `f2` 588.7 vs 695.5. But D192's `mm` — the latency-bound HVX read of
    the arena (rule 26) — read 922.7 / 931.9 here vs 937.0 there (< 1 %),
    and the `hot` cell 31.25 / 32.17 ns/tile vs 31.25. The unit difference
    sits in the DMA engine (or its clock), not in DDR or HVX; rule 32's
    "31–32 GB/s is the real bound" is `R3CY205ZMND`'s number, and three
    anchor values now exist (40.2 once, 31.2–31.4 twice, 37.1–37.3 twice).
    Consequences: (a) an absolute `mm` gate on a DMA-fed path is read
    next to the sitting's anchor — #117's 676.4 passes 760 as measured
    and would read ≈ 805–809 on a 31.2 GB/s unit; (b) a DMA-fed path's
    win is unit-dependent (931.9 / 676.4 = 1.38× here, ≈ 1.16× projected
    there, decode ≈ +10 % instead of +30 %) while a direct-read path's is
    not; (c) what transfers between units is the decode half of a gate
    (B ≥ A at all G, text = A), the `mm` half is scaled; (d) the goal's
    ceiling is per unit too: 22.02 MB × 22 = 484 MB/token of MoE weights
    is 13.0 ms at 37.3 and 15.5 at 31.2.
35. **Under the VTCM feed the M==1 transport falls 190 → 92 µs/call: the
    "+100 µs GEMV path cost" of ⑦ / #100's A/A0 belonged to the direct
    HVX arena read, not to the GEMV path.** #100 read GEMV 185.8 vs HMX
    84.6 µs (one sitting, equal staging classes) and the ledger called it
    path cost that "comes back only with ⑨". #117's B (GEMV + DMA feed)
    reads 82.0 / 92.3 in two sittings against A's 184.6 / 190.3 in the
    same sitting and binary (`qos_mode=2`, `staging:` identical) — the
    HMX path's level. 22 × ≈ 0.1 = 2.2 ms/token came back with the feed.
    Cause not separated (candidates: the HVX arena read leaves the
    ARM-side cache maintenance or the `dmlink` sync more to do at the
    call boundary; the shorter call stays inside the poll window).
    Corollary: `transport` is read beside `mm` on every DSP-path variant —
    a DSP-side read pattern moves the host column.

36. **A switch proven on the host is not live on the device until the
    device log prints its banner — the Android app never carried
    `ENABLE_HEXKL`.** `Applications/CausalLM/jni/Android.mk` takes its
    defines from the prebuilt `Android.mk`'s `NNTRAINER_EXPORT_CFLAGS`
    (`-march` + the two FP16 ABI defines only, `jni/meson.build`
    `2f642ab7`), so every `#ifdef ENABLE_HEXKL` block of the app
    (`lfm2_moe_causallm.cpp`'s op list and `set_decode_graph_desc`,
    `htp_decode_hook.h`'s four hooks) compiled out of every device app
    since #85 while `libnntrainer.so` itself had the define. #130's first
    pass of B / C printed no `graph: init` and ran at A's speed; the host
    gates (`graph_host_check`, `run_inproc_e2e.sh`, meson) never go
    through that makefile and cannot see it. Consequences: (1) a variant
    whose expected banner is missing is **void**, never "at A's speed";
    (2) every handoff's sanity block greps the app library for the
    switch's own string (`strings libcausallm_core.so | grep -c
    NNTR_HTP_FORWARD_KINDS` ≥ 1) next to the `graph: forward calls` check
    on `libnntrainer.so`; (3) since #135 `jni/meson.build` exports
    `-DENABLE_HEXKL=1` through the prebuilt `Android.mk` whenever
    `libnntrainer.so` has it, `build_android.sh` exits 1 when the app's
    count disagrees with `--htp`, and the `hexagon-gates` rung 3 /
    `hexagon-handoff` sanity block carry the line (the local
    `-DENABLE_HEXKL=1` ndk-build of handoff 130 Notes ① is gone).
    The M1-GEMV / feed defaults of PRs #108 / #115 / #118 live in
    `libnntrainer.so` and the skel and are unaffected (their banners were
    in every log).
37. **`hvx_emu` is not the silicon on subnormal / tiny values; it is on
    normal-range rows.** The wired kernels, bit-exact to their `_det`
    specs on the host emulation, are bit-exact on the device for every
    normal-range row (rmsnorm kinds 0 / 1 / 3 `bad=0`, ATTN_M1 `out
    bad=0` at L = 1 … 1024) and differ by a few ulp only where the values
    are ≈ 2^-120 … 2^-132: rmsnorm kind=2 (the ±1e-39 row) `bad_y=2048`
    of 2048, qk_norm `bad_y=64`, rope64 `bad=10…18 of 2560` at pos ≥ 1,
    conv_gate_m1 `bad_out=229`, ATTN_M1 `bad_stats=1` (the (m, l) pair) at
    L = 63 / 512 / 1024. Rule 24 (v79 keeps subnormals) stands — the rows
    are not flushed — but the emulation's rounding of tiny values is not
    the hardware's to the bit (candidates: the `qf32` intermediates and
    `Q6_Vsf_equals_Vqf32`, the `vrsqrt` / `vrecip` seeds, one op's
    input flush). Consequences: gate (a) "bit-identical on the device" is
    passed on real-valued rows and open on the subnormal rows until #137
    decides which side is wrong; and **B's degenerate text is not this** —
    lanes at 2^-120 cannot move a logit. ~~so #136 is a logic / binding
    fault, not an arithmetic one~~ — **withdrawn by rule 39 (#136, cycle
    20 close)**: it is neither; it is last-bit differences on
    normal-range rows amplified by the quantized pipeline. `rmsnorm
    kind=2 bad_y=2048` is the ±1e-39 row itself (every element tiny),
    i.e. this rule as written, not a larger error.
38. **`AEE_ERPC` (`0x80000600`, "error due to fastrpc implementation",
    `AEEStdErr.h`) on a bad-shape call means the call never reached the
    entry's validator.** `RejectsBadShapes` in both suites expected the
    entry's `AEE_EINVALIDFORMAT` / `AEE_EBADPARM` (+ `0x80000400`) and got
    `AEE_ERPC` for every bad shape: the FastRPC stub / skel marshalling
    rejects a sequence whose length disagrees with the declared shape
    before the entry runs, which the host check (no marshalling layer)
    cannot show. A device negative test either sends shapes the
    marshalling accepts and lets the entry reject them, or reads
    `AEE_ERPC` as the rejection and says so (#137). Not a stale skel
    (`0x8000040e` never appeared; the skel md5 was in every log).
39. **Text identity cannot hold for any resident kind on this quantized
    pipeline; per-kind last-bit exactness is checked by recomputing
    dumped stretch inputs; the gate is decode PPL + text + approval**
    (#136, 2026-09-28, `R3CY10WM83Y`; §2 #136 row). The host put
    RMSNORM at 129 dB and the attention stretch at 39 dB on the fixture
    and read both as harmless; on silicon each alone moves the first
    decode token's first MoE input to 34 / 40 dB and its last to 18 dB,
    and RMSNORM + ROPE + ATTN_M1 together flip the greedy token at pos
    512 (`town` → `final`) while every other executable mask keeps the
    text. The kernel is not the cause: every dumped RMSNORM input,
    recomputed in the Android CPU's order
    (`neon::rms_norm_wrt_width_fp32_intrinsic`), sits at **131–148 dB**
    against the DSP output, and the DSP row scale is the nearer to f64
    (0.7–3.9 × 10⁻⁸ vs the CPU order's 1.5–27 × 10⁻⁸). Switch-off and
    `KINDS=MOE` are bit-identical run to run, so every dB below ∞ is what
    a resident kind puts in; the amplifier is the CPU Q4_0 GEMM's
    per-block activation quantizer and the MoE's u8 quantizer, which
    flip a level wherever a value sits on a rounding boundary (⑱'s
    mechanism). Consequences: (1) a per-token-entry variant whose text
    differs from A is neither a defect nor a pass by that fact — the
    contract §1 gate decides (decode PPL vs A of the same sitting ≤ +2 %,
    the text column, the user's approval; the text column is never
    dropped); (2) a resident kernel's device exactness is checked per
    kind by recomputing its dumped stretch inputs (`NNTR_HTP_DUMP_ALL`,
    PR #143) against its `_det` spec or the CPU order, never inferred
    from end-to-end text; (3) SNR at the MoE inputs is a diagnostic, not
    a gate, and the host's 30 dB floor (plan 130) does not predict the
    device text; (4) the mask that flips text is prompt-dependent — the
    bisect named a pair only because two perturbations stacked at one
    near-tie, so it names no faulty op.

40. **The M==1 MoE call's transport is the FastRPC invoke itself;
    dspqueue with a spinning DSP thread takes it from ≈ 88 to 14 µs/call
    without moving a bit — and the spin is what buys it.** #147's
    microbench read F12 (FastRPC, 12 KiB ION) 87.1 µs vs QSS12 (both sides
    spin) 16.7, QBS12 (DSP blocks) 28.9, QBB12 (both block) 76.9; in the
    model (#141 step 2) the level-2 M==1 row read A `transport` 87.9 vs Q
    14.1 µs/call with `dsp` −1.3 %, `mm` −0.2 %, and decode +7.1 / +5.0 %
    (G 64 / 512), while Q0 (DSP blocks at once) kept only +4.8 / +0.4 %.
    The DSP runs the FastRPC method's own function on the same argument
    bytes, so the MoE dumps are `bit_identical=1` (2862 files) and the text
    ≡ A on 8 prompts — a transport change is bit-preserving by construction
    and is gated by dumps + text, not by PPL. Consequences: (1) since PR #151
    (`08de92b1`, flip `c73384d2`) variant A of every sitting is the queue:
    its log prints `[HTP] dspq: on …` once and `dspq: close calls=N served=N
    bad=0` (N = 22 × decode steps); no `on` line or a `dspq: off (…)` banner
    is the FastRPC fallback and voids the sitting (rule 36); A0 is
    `NNTR_HTP_DSPQ=0`; (2) the transport term of the budget is now
    22 × 0.014 = 0.3 ms/token — nothing is left to win on it; (3) the DSP
    spin window (1 ms) keeps one HVX-free DSP thread hot between the 22
    calls; the ARM spins up to 5 ms, which #150 must count when it reads
    CPU-side contention (its first read ran on the FastRPC build).
41. *(Cycle 22: this rule describes the L2 path, `NNTR_MOE_DMA_BYPASS=0`;
    the default since `21169f6e` bypasses the DSP L2 and reads ≈ 57 GB/s
    in the app — rule 43.)* **In the app the DMA engine reads ≈ 0.88 × the isolated anchor per
    byte, cold and warm alike; there is no fetch-schedule lever; the MoE
    `mm` floor on this unit is ≈ 670 µs, not 590** (#149 step 0, no
    build). On one skel and unit: anchor 37.3 GB/s, `traced` / `traced_f`
    / `f2` / `f2_load` 37.2–37.5, the `vtcm` bench 37.64 (`mm` 585 µs),
    but the in-app per-descriptor median 32.9 (level 2, cold, n = 528)
    and 33.0 (level 3, warm) = 0.88 × the anchor. The ring never idles
    (each descriptor starts at its predecessor's completion), gu0 and gu1
    already leave before the activation quant, and the ring order is
    already e+1's gate_up before e's down, so ㉓'s three candidates are
    worth ≤ 3, 0 and 0 µs. Warm ≈ cold rules out the cold call (TLB /
    page walk) as the cause; the remaining cause (DDR contention from the
    ARM side between calls, a bus clock vote in the app, or the engine
    sharing with the HVX read) is not separated and no schedule change
    can reach it. Consequences: (1) ㉓ (feed engine) is closed with no
    code; (2) the MoE `dsp` floor per call on `R3CY10WM83Y` is 22.02 MB /
    33 GB/s ≈ 670 µs (`mm` measured 673.7–677.2), i.e. **22 × 0.670 =
    14.7 ms/token**, not rule 34's 13.0 — the goal's per-unit ceiling
    reads against the in-app rate; (3) rule 34's anchor stays the
    cross-unit scale, the in-app rate the budget's.
42. **The per-token byte count is ≈ 886 MB on the NPU path and ≈ 947 on
    the CPU path, not 730; the CPU reads ≈ 50 GB/s in decode, not
    34–38.** Counted from `config.json` and checked against both model
    files: MoE 22 layers × 4 experts × 3 × 2048 × 1792 = 969 M weights
    (`QS4CX_WH` 484 MB/token, Q4_0 545); the dense Q4_0 FCs = conv
    `in_proj` 3 × 2048 and `out_proj` 2048 per conv layer (18 × 16.8 M =
    302 M) + attention q / k / v / o (6 × 10.5 M = 63 M) + the dense FFN of
    layers 0–1 (2 × 3 × 2048 × 7168 = 88 M) = 453 M = **255 MB**; lm_head
    (tied) 262 M = **147 MB**. The all-Q4_0 file (4 768.9 MB) = 4 360 MoE
    + 255 + 147 (once, tied) = 4 762 — the count holds within 0.2 %; the
    NPU file (4 316.1 MB) = 3 875 + 255 + 147 + ≈ 39 of scales / padding.
    Doc 48 §1's 730 MB leaves 730 − 484 − 147 = 99 MB for the FCs; where
    that figure came from is not reconstructed here, but it is ≈ 156 MB
    short of the file. Consequences: (1) the CPU control's
    52.4 tok/s at G=64 is ≈ 49.7 GB/s effective (§2 ④ read the CPU alone
    at 67.9) — the "ceiling 48–52 tok/s, the CPU sits on it" of contract
    §1 is an arithmetic artefact; (2) on the NPU path the time outside the
    MoE call (≈ 9.7 ms at G=64, ≈ 10.8 at G=512 on #141 Q) reads ≥ 402 MB,
    so the CPU's M=1 Q4_0 GEMVs already run at ≥ 37–41 GB/s effective;
    the "≈ 6.5 ms byte floor" of the budgets was 246 MB at 38 GB/s and is
    **≈ 5.9 ms at the CPU's 67.9 alone, ≈ 10.6 at 38**; (3) any DSP-side
    reader of those 402 MB runs at ≤ 33 GB/s in the app (rule 41) = ≥ 12 ms,
    slower than the CPU does it today, so moving the Q4_0 FCs to the DSP
    is not a byte lever at all (㉘); what is left outside the call is the
    CPU's own GEMV rate (#150). This is arithmetic on measured tok/s and
    file sizes, not a new device reading.

43. **The DSP L2 on the weight DMA's source path cost almost half the DMA
    rate: `src_bypass=1` on the arena expert weights reads 69.3 GB/s
    isolated and ≈ 57 in the app, and moves no bit** (#158, PR #159). Probe
    (fresh 168 MiB DDR→VTCM, tag-validated, two runs): **37.3 GB/s with
    `src_bypass=0`** (= rule 34's anchor) **vs 69.3 with `src_bypass=1`**
    (+85.6 %); more UDMA queues from several HW threads add nothing. In the
    app (level 2, G=64): M==1 ring `engine 31.5..33.4 → 56.3..57.9 GB/s`,
    `dsp` **726.0 → 417.5 µs/call**, `first expert ready at` 123 → 77 µs;
    M>1 `dsp` −2.7 %. Per-op at G=512: MoE wait 16.07 → **9.85 ms/token**,
    token 26.0 → 19.74. Decode **+34.2 / +35.3 / +30.9 %** at G 64 / 512 /
    1024. The bytes cannot change: arena slots are filled by the CPU before
    `arena_attach` and never written on the DSP, so no source line in the
    L2 is dirty; dumps `bit_identical=1` (2862), nll lines B == A, text 8/8.
    Consequences: (1) rule 41's 0.88 × anchor and ≈ 670 µs floor are the
    L2 path's; on the default the in-app rate is ≈ 0.82 × the bypass probe
    (57 / 69.3) and the M==1 `dsp` ≈ 418 µs/call = **9.2 ms/token**;
    rule 34's anchor stays the cross-unit scale of the L2 path only; (2)
    the "37 GB/s vs T-MAN's 59" gap was the source-side L2, not the
    descriptor shape, the queue count or DVFS (none of the 2026-09-22..28
    probes set the bit); (3) since `21169f6e` an A log must print
    `applied=0x703e1 … dma_bypass=1 source=default` once; `dma_bypass=0`
    without `NNTR_MOE_DMA_BYPASS=0` set voids the sitting (rule 36); A0 =
    `NNTR_MOE_DMA_BYPASS=0` (`0x303e1`). **The unset banner has not been
    seen on the device yet** (host checks and the in-process E2E only);
    (4) heap slots, activation blocks and the staging copies keep
    `src_bypass=0` (the DSP writes them); #157's cached ARM arena still
    needs its own clean per fill — the ARM caches are not the DSP L2.
44. **The phone's DRAM tops out at ≈ 70 GB/s for any mix of readers; a
    second reader redistributes the bandwidth, it does not add to it**
    (#90, cold probe, every line `valid=y`, `INVALID` 0). CPU alone 63.0 /
    68.1 / 69.4 / 68.3 GB/s (1 / 2 / 4 / 8 threads); DSP ring alone 37.3
    (L2 path); CPU + ring **69.5–71.5 aggregate** (CPU 38.5–40.6, −36..44 %;
    ring 30.9–31.3, −16..17 %); CPU + HVX direct 64.6–66.6; warm 63.9–70.2.
    Consequences: (1) ④ / Q11 answered — the two-reader ceiling is ≈ 70,
    not 38 + 68; for the NPU model 886 MB / 70 GB/s = 12.7 ms ≈ 79 tok/s is
    this phone's hard ceiling; (2) with the bypass (rule 43) the DSP alone
    takes ≈ 57 of the 70 during the MoE window, so ≈ 13 GB/s is left for a
    concurrent CPU reader: #157's split and #90's prefetch overlap (S = 4
    MiB: DSP `mm` unchanged, **+0.7 to +1.4 ms/token**; S = 10 passes warm
    only; S ≥ 20 costs 0.6–4.2 ms — all measured on the L2 path) must be
    re-read on the bypass default before anything is built on them.
45. **Repetition in free-running text is the deciding accuracy failure,
    even when the decode PPL passes; the bit-preserving rule stays** (user
    direction 2026-09-29, after #152). #152's D1 (resident ROPE + ATTN_M1,
    now bit-identical to the Android fp16 CPU attention: G0 / G1 `bad=0`,
    `N_attn` dumps `bit_identical=1`) kept the decode PPL within +0.9 % of A
    on every one of the 8 prompts at G=256 and still got **user `n` on all
    8** (repetition); the remaining difference is the norms (`N_rms` 2.64
    dB, a routing flip; `N_qk` 28.68 dB). **The baseline A itself loops at
    G=256 on p02 p03 p05 p06 p08** (`tools/htp/loop_check.py --prompt`); D1
    adds a new loop on **p04** (Korean). It also fails speed: exact ATTN_M1
    `dsp_us` 1736.6 warm at pos 1023 (gate 940; #148's f32 kernel 387), D1
    decode 25.91 / 24.55 / 22.51 vs A 38.87 / 38.54 / 35.53. Consequences:
    (1) the PPL half of contract §1's amended gate (c) never passes a
    variant by itself; a non-bit-identical variant needs text ≡ A or the
    user's approval, and a new loop fails it; (2) a loop counts against a
    variant only where A's own text does not loop; (3) track (c) (the
    resident path) stays off by default, now also on speed.
46. **The CPU side of NPU decode is near its byte floor; the term that
    grows with G is attention** (#150 step 1b, `NNTR_OP_TIME=1` proven
    inert: T8 within A0's spread, dumps `bit_identical=1`, nll equal). At
    G=512 on the dspq default: token 26.22 ms = MoE wait 16.08 (61 %) + ≈
    10.1 on the CPU; the Q4_0 FCs stream at **51–63 GB/s** (conv in_proj
    51.1, out_proj 53.1, attn o 53.6, dense FFN 57.2, lm_head 61.4; only
    the fused qkv + q/k norm 37.4); FC + lm_head 7.4 ms for 402 MB (floor at
    60 GB/s ≈ 6.7); attention (mha_core) **1.47 ms at G=512, 1.97 at
    G=1024** (#90); norms / adds / conv1d / sampling / register ≈ 0.6;
    unattributed 0.28. Threads 8 / 6 / 4 move decode within the spread and
    cost prefill 8–35 %; CPU clocks sit at 2.0–3.1 GHz during decode.
    Consequences: (1) rule 42 (2)'s "≥ 37–41 GB/s effective" is superseded
    by the per-op 51–63; (2) the bit-preserving CPU headroom is ≈ 0.5–1 ms
    at G=512 (qkv, attention, unattributed) and larger at G=1024 only
    through attention; (3) after the bypass the CPU part (≈ 9.9 ms of
    19.74 at G=512) is half the token and the only lever left for G=1024
    (#162, ㉙).

47. **The HTP norm is bit-identical to the Android CPU once its row scale

    `dev/norm-shadow` sitting: 21 of 49 RMSNORM calls fully equal, the
    rest max 2–4 ulp, 136–142 dB, tag0 185/392); with r as 16 `sffma`
    chains + pairwise reduce + integer RN sqrt and reciprocal: RMSNORM
    **392/392** rows, QK_NORM **1920/1920** heads, logits == A on 8/8
    steps, dumps `bit_identical=1`, nll and text ≡ A on 8 prompts at
    G=256. Cost of the new r ≈ +0.05–0.1 ms/token; the gates set from
    the ISS (RMSNORM ≤ 4000, QK_NORM ≤ 25 000 pcyc/op) read **16 077 /
    33 629** on silicon (DDR latency the ISS does not model) — pcyc gates
    are set from a silicon baseline, never from the ISS. Decode with the
    norms resident: R (71 calls/token) −20…−25 %, RQ (77) −38…−50 %, and
    R / A = 0.799 vs 0.773 with the old kernel the same day: the loss is
    the 71–77 calls, so the norms pay only inside a one-call-per-token
    path. Left for #137: the ±1e-39 row (`kind=2 bad_y=2048`) and
    `RejectsBadShapes` on `AEE_ERPC`.
48. **A qf32 multiply + qf32 add narrowed once to hf reproduces the CPU's
    fused fp16 FMA (`fmla .8h`) bit for bit on v79 silicon** (#170 S1:
    0 bad of 4878 replayed + 76 800 adversarial + 25 600 zero / sign
    cases; hf add / sub / mul / max exhaustive-sampled 0 bad; vector exp16
    0 bad of 31 745; div16 0 bad of 27 049 hard quotients — the first time
    today's divide ran on silicon). Two things the host cannot see: (1)
    **hexagon-clang 19 `-O3` folds an explicit `Vsf_equals_Vqf32` into
    the next qf32 op**, skipping the rounding the spec requires — every
    pinned rounding is an empty `asm` (`hvx_hf_pin`), and the ISS was
    bit-exact either way, so a fold shows only on silicon or in the `-S`;
    (2) `Q6_Vqf32_equals_Vsf` is v81-only. Cost: today's `fma16_sf` 8.06
    pcyc per 64-lane FMA at 6 lanes, the qf32 loops 1.96 (scores, one q
    head per Kt load) and 1.26 (pv4); a two-heads-per-load shape stops
    scaling past 2–4 lanes. In-model ATTN_M1 2.47 M → **394.5 k** (G=64)
    and 4.75 M → **700.4 k** (G=1024) pcyc/op = −84 / −85 %, bit-identical
    (Q1 / RQ1 ≡ A 8/8, user `y`), gates 210 k / 350 k missed 2×; round 2
    (PR #182) **250.3 k / 373.6 k**, missed by 19 / 7 %. **Fetch rule
    from the phase words:** a plain 6-lane stream reads 38 GB/s and an
    `l2fetch` lead adds nothing to it (S1), but a *dependent* single-lane
    chain (the PV V rows: 47 pcyc/FMA cold vs 6.9 warm) is latency-bound
    and a 32 KiB windowed lead takes it 37.8 → 7.14 at one lane, 7.55 →
    3.12 at six (PV 1545 k → 386 k); the same lead on a bus-bound tile
    fetch (scores at 6 lanes) buys 11.8 → 9.96 cold and costs +9.5 % warm.
    Round 3 opens with a measurement (split the softmax word: exp16, ET
    stores, max, sum, divides) before any kernel change.
49. **Only the `hvx_intrin` variant of the CPU-exact Q4_0 FC is
    bit-identical on v79 silicon; the `-mhvx-ieee-fp` native `.sf`

    in every cell although host, hvx_emu and the ISS pass all five**
    (#132 PR 2 Part A, PR #175, 2026-09-29). The CPU-order specs equal
    the phone's shipped CPU functions (Q8 quantizer 4000 rows, Q4 GEMV 5
    shapes × 2000 rows, SwiGLU, `sgemv_n` router, **bionic `expf` over all
    4 278 190 082 inputs bad=0**), and in the model the shadow's add
    96/96 and router 176/176 records equal the CPU's. Rate: the exact FC +
    lm_head at 6 lanes **VTCM-fed 7.88 ms/token** (fc 5.14 + lm_head
    2.74; 45.5 GB/s) against the CPU's 7.4, **DDR-direct 30 ms** (11.8
    GB/s) — an FC on the DSP must be DMA-fed like the MoE; the scalar
    activation quantizer adds **4.8 ms/token** (ponytail, HVX version
    needed) and the CPU-exact scalar-chain ROUTER_TOPK costs **427 784
    pcyc/op vs 34 100** (≈ 4.4 ms/token; HVX / multi-chain version
    needed). Address space: **113 MiB allocatable** in the loaded app vs
    383 MiB for the FC set + lm_head. These are decision D's inputs
    (user).
50. **A second cDSP session beside the loaded app exists and is cheap to
    talk to, but it gets no VTCM, and a PD must never grow its DSP heap
    to the end of its address space** (#178, 2026-09-29/30).
    `remote_session_control` reserve + open rc=0 in **22 ms** (lite path,
    no HMX; S1 keeps `hmx_locked=1` and its 8 MiB VTCM); **the 4 GiB is
    per PD** (S2 maps 3584 MiB while S1 holds 3840); the 74 `q4m1`
    weights (383 MiB) fit on S2's heap. Hops: dspqueue spin **2.8 / 12.7
    µs** (0 B / 12 KiB), blocking 36–47, a shared mailbox page both PDs
    poll **0.33 / 2.4 µs** (0 B / 8 KiB), 10 000/10 000, no thread cost —
    44 hops/token ≈ 0.1–0.6 ms. DDR: S1 alone 70 GB/s, S2 alone 20
    (L2-fed), concurrent **58–60 + 15–17** (the rule-44 ceiling; S1's MoE
    feed −17 %), sequential 26–27. **S2 VTCM = 0** (S1 holds all 8 MiB),
    so the exact FC in S2 is L2-fed: **8.06 ms/token** (K=7168 at 26 GB/s
    on 3 lanes — 6 lanes is slower; K=2048 at 52), direct 33. Projected
    two-session end-to-end **≈ 21–22 ms/token ≈ 45–46 tok/s** vs the
    hybrid A's 18.4–19.7 (50.6–54.3). **Defect and rule:** the set2 probe
    grew S2's heap to the end of its space; at S2's close a 2 MiB heap
    page failed to unmap (`remote_munmap64 … 0x80000441`) and the cDSP
    lost ≈ 192–256 MiB of mapping room for every later process (the app's
    arena died at `fastrpc_mmap(64 MiB) … mapped=3584 MiB`) until a
    reboot. Removing that cell fixed it (set3: `s1_mmap_mib=3840` after
    each probe, post-probe app sanities generate). Every second-session
    probe or design caps its heap growth and is bracketed by an app run.
51. **Neither bit-preserving CPU-side lever at G=1024 pays** (#162,
    2026-09-29). (a) The decode attention split (`split4`, `kv_ilp`)
    gives no speedup at L 1024 / 1536 (`as_is` 140.6 / 216.6 µs per layer
    at 8 threads vs 143–157 / 230–238), and the microbench covers only
    ≈ 50 % of the in-app `mha_core` (6 × 0.14 = 0.84 ms vs 1.68–1.87
    ms/token): the in-app attention is half something the kernel does not
    model (the qkv / cache traffic around it), so a kernel-only speedup
    cannot reach the ≈ 1.1 ms G=1024 needs. (b) The prefetch overlap
    (8 threads touching the next layer's first 4 MiB of FC weights during
    the MoE wait) passes the probe's rule P′ under the bypass (net
    +1.0…+1.6 ms/token cold, +0.6…+1.3 warm, `dmm_pct` −3.1) yet reads
    **+1.30 / −0.43 / −1.30 %** in the app against a mirrored A — inside
    A's own spread — with dumps, nll and text identical. The probe's
    "net" credits a hot re-read the app does not realise (the FCs already
    stream at 51–63 GB/s, rule 46); a probe-level saving under 1.5
    ms/token is not a lever until the app confirms it. The S25's DMA
    queues 2 / 4 under the bypass read 67.9 / 63.9 vs 69.2 GB/s on one
    (rule 43 reconfirmed; the S26 scales, #177).
52. **The G=1024 cell moves ±6 % with the start temperature on one unit
    within one day; a "≥ 50" read there is temperature-bound until a
    mirrored cool sitting is taken for it** (cycle 23, `R3CY10WM83Y`,
    2026-09-29/30, eight A cells on the same binary default). Cool starts
    (zone0 25–33 °C) read **52–55 / 51–54 / 50–52** at G 64 / 512 / 1024
    (G=1024: 52.36, 50.90, 51.26, 50.86, 51.59, 51.40; two cool-start
    sittings that ran hot by their G=1024 cells read 49.11 and 48.26); the
    hot #164 sitting (57–65 °C) read 47.88 / 49.50 / 45.86. The row of
    record stays #158 B's 47.36 (a mirrored A/B, read as the lever it
    was): BENCHMARK's "now" moves only with a sitting taken as a control
    (A twice per G, cool, nothing set) or with a bit-identical lever
    accepted as the default (rule 33 / cycle 21), and no cycle-23 cell was
    either. Corollary for every handoff: a G=1024 verdict needs the A of
    the same sitting *and* its thermal checkpoints next to it. The pending
    unset-banner check of the bypass flip is done: every cycle-23 A log
    printed `applied=0x703e1 … dma_bypass=1 source=default` with nothing
    set.
    **Resolved 2026-09-30 by the record sitting** (`record-2026-09-30-cool-a.md`):
    A twice per G, nothing set, each G block started at zone0 ≤ 35 °C →
    **53.97 / 52.16 / 51.41** (G=1024 51.54 / 51.29, ending 64.5–65.6 °C);
    the row of record moved there, #158 B's 51.82 / 50.61 / 47.36 stays as
    the warm-start reading. The rule stands as the row's condition: a
    G=1024 number is quoted with its start temperature, and a warm-start
    A of this default reads 47–49 there.
53. **The inline-asm IEEE HVX `.sf` forms do not execute on v79
    silicon: `Vd.sf = vadd / vsub / vmpy(Vu.sf, Vv.sf)` (assembled with
    `-mhvx-ieee-fp`) return `0x00000000` in every lane, while the ISS
    runs them as IEEE ops; use the `Q6_Vsf_*` intrinsics (a qf32 op and a
    conversion, which the compiler emits even with `-mhvx-ieee-fp`) or
    the scalar `sffma`** (#132 PR 2 sitting S3, `R3CY10WM83Y`,
    2026-09-30, `HvxFcQ4.SfProbe`: 256/256 random normal pairs and the
    kernel's own operands, asm form `0x0`, intrinsics and scalar sffma
    bad=0). This is rule 49's cause: `hvx_native` used the asm form for
    every op, the sffma variants for their scale terms; #164's norm and
    the router never did. A kernel that passes on the ISS with the asm
    form proves nothing about silicon. Same sitting: the scalar
    `sfrecipa / sffixup` divide equals the integer RN divide on every
    mantissa of amax / 127 and 1 / d (50 331 648 divides); the
    ISS-to-silicon pcycle ratio of scalar-heavy DSP code read ×1.3–1.4
    (router 65 528 vs ≈ 50 k projected, quantizer ≈ 14.7 k vs 10.7 k).

54. **With two cDSP sessions in one app, map session 1's arena before
    session 2 opens; whichever PD maps while the other is open and
    mapped stops at 14 × 256 MiB (3584 MiB)** (#132 Part B E5 vs E5b,
    `R3CY10WM83Y`, 2026-09-30). E5 opened S2 first and placed its 383.6
    MiB FC set (`mapped_mib=448`), then S1's MoE arena died at
    `fastrpc_mmap(64 MiB) failed: err=1 … mapped=3584 MiB in 14 chunks`
    (3696 needed) — the same 3584 the #178 probe's S2 stopped at beside
    S1's 3840 (rule 50). Reordered (S2 opens after `repack_weight` has
    mapped S1, `54a30c7f`, banner `s1_arena_mib=3840`), E5b loaded and
    ran: S2 open 24 ms, attach 383.6 MiB, load 685 ms, startup +343 ms
    vs A, `calls/token=1.00`, `hops/token=44`, no leak across five
    reboot-bracketed sets. The driver-side cause is not known; the order
    is the rule. Rule 50's heap rule stands beside it (never grow a PD's
    heap to the end of its space; a leaked 2 MiB page needs a reboot).
55. **A resident kind is proven only by its own same-input CPU-vs-HTP
    shadow over ≥ 64 decode steps; G = 4 / 8 dumps, equal logits for
    eight steps and identical text on most prompts prove nothing about
    a kind that has no shadow** (#132 Part B E5b → E5c → E5e, 2026-09-30).
    E5b passed every G=8 check (46 MoE dumps `bit_identical=1`, every
    shadowed op equal, Ev logits == S0, nll == A for 8 steps) and then
    left A at decode step 25 (prompt512) / 5 (korean) / 26 (p07) on 8/8
    prompts, text ≡ A on 5/8; the host build (x86) reproduced nothing
    over 256 steps. E5c: the one-session `NNTR_HTP_FORWARD=1` path and
    the two-session path leave A at the **same** step and row
    (`step24/pos536/L13.in`, `step4/pos330/L17.in`) while every
    shadowed op stays equal over 64 steps — so the row comes from the
    one resident kind without a shadow, **CONV1D_GATE**: the DSP
    computed `(w0·g + w1·s1) + w2·s0` with every op rounded, the phone's
    decode is `fma(w2, s0, fma(w1, s1, w0·g))` (`vmulq` + two `vfmaq`);
    1 ulp apart on ≈ 13–16 % of outputs, hidden by out_proj's Q8
    quantizer except rarely and data-dependently. Fixed with the CPU's
    fused order (scalar `sffma` taps, `a0bf121b`): E5e S and Ev
    bit-identical over 64 steps on both prompts, conv shadow 1152/1152.
    Corollaries: (1) every resident kind ships with a shadow (the list
    is now FC, ADD, ROUTER, SwiGLU, argmax, RMSNORM / QK_NORM, ATTN_M1,
    CONV1D_GATE; DENSE_FFN and LM_HEAD ride the FC shadow); (2) a spec
    written in the kernel's order is not a spec — it is held against
    the CPU function (`fmaf` model) as #164 and Part A did; (3) the
    prefill `hvx_conv_gate_f32` is unfused the same way (only the HTP
    conv-block prefill engine uses it — open, not on the decode path).
56. **A PD that spins on a hop steals a hardware thread from the PD that
    is computing; across two cDSP sessions the hop wait must sleep,
    not spin** (#132 Part B E5b → E5d, 2026-09-30). With `tk_take`
    spinning 1000 µs (no pause, a flush-invalidate per iteration) the
    two-session path read **16.7 / 16.0 / 15.2 tok/s** against A's
    53.5–55.1 / 54.4–54.8 / 52.4–52.9: both sessions strictly alternate
    and each computed 2–3× slower than its isolated kernels (S1's 22
    MoE + router rounds ≈ 2.7× the isolated MoE's cycles; 108 M pcyc
    over a 59 ms token ≈ 1.8 GHz, so not the clock) — S1's MoE runs six
    lanes on a pool barrier, and one starved lane stretches every call;
    the pools' own ≈ 100 µs post-job spin does the same at each hop.
    Spin 0 / 20 / 1000 µs → **spin 0 best: 20.8 tok/s at G=64, 19.5 at
    G=512**, text ≡ A, S1's MoE back at its isolated rate (9.67 ms =
    0.44 ms/round). Per kind after the fix (G=64, ms/token): S1 MoE
    9.67 + router 0.79; S2 FC 8.75, DENSE_FFN 5.60, LM_HEAD 5.97,
    ATTN_M1 8.33 (the pre-#170 kernel in that branch), small ≈ 1.2; ARM
    token 44.7 ms. Same-PD rule 40 (the dspqueue's 1 ms DSP spin helps
    the single-session MoE transport) does not transfer to two PDs.
57. **A single-session map window for the FC set is not viable: an
    ARM-side `fastrpc_mmap` + `munmap` of an 11 MiB window costs ≈ 1.4
    ms per pair, and the unsigned PD cannot map on its own** (#192,
    `R3CY10WM83Y`, 2026-09-30 07:59, after a reboot). Per pair `fd` 1.40
    ms / `fd_delayed` 1.55 → **33.4 / 36.7 ms/token** for 22 layers;
    DSP-side `HAP_mmap` answers `0x80000402` (not available to the
    unsigned PD, whatever rpc.html lists); re-attach by copy into a
    long-mapped 24 MiB window 0.72 ms copy + 0.36 ms repoint → 23.8
    ms/token; a freshly mapped window costs the first FC call +115 µs
    (456 vs 341); lm_head 140 MiB whole map 2.84 ms + unmap 0.21 (328
    MiB VA headroom beside the arena and the window) or 12 × 12 MiB
    slices ≈ 15 ms/token. Stop rule (> 1.0 ms/token) hit by 30×;
    sanities before / after generate, no leak. The resident FC set
    needs the second session (rules 50, 54) or stays on the CPU.
58. **The ISS prices HVX compute right and memory-side scalar work
    wrong: a scalar gather after HVX stores read 3× the ISS on silicon
    and an L1 prefetch that took the ISS −60 % moved silicon −5 %**
    (#170 S4 and #132 S4, `R3CY10WM83Y`, 2026-09-30). (a) #170's exp
    table (`attn_m1_det_exp_table`, a 3-op vector index + batched
    scalar gather) was priced 272 k → 115 k lane-summed on the ISS;
    on silicon the gather reads **387 k** against the exp16 compute's
    **272 k** it replaced (the ISS's 271 k, 1.0×) — six threads issuing
    scalar loads after HVX stores is what the ISS cannot model; `pool`
    still fell (307 k → 276–281 k) because the `vlut16` q operand cut
    `scores` 681 k → 392 k (warm 601 → 314 k), so both in-model gates
    passed (193 838 / 313 747 vs 210 k / 350 k) with the table on;
    `-DATTN_M1_EXP_TAB=0` (host bit-identical, kept) is round 4's first
    cell, then `vgather` from a VTCM carve-out. The other softmax
    pieces are also larger on silicon than on the ISS (`div` 140 k vs
    90 k, `et` 73 k vs 41 k, `max + sum` 26 k vs 15 k), which is why
    G6b's ratio (0.507 vs 0.55–0.75) missed although the split held.
    (b) #132's router: a row `dcfetch` 8 ahead took the ISS model of an
    8-chain group 47.7 k → 13.8 k pcycles and silicon 65 528 → **62 311**
    pcyc/op (−5 %; gate 60 k missed by 4 %, accepted: ≈ 0.65 ms/token);
    the ISS's L1 miss per weight row is not what bounds the loop on
    silicon (candidates: the 4-lane fork / join, the serial sigmoid +
    pick tail, `sffma` chain latency — needs stage timers inside the
    op). Extends rules 47 and 53: an ISS pcycle gate is a projection,
    the silicon reading decides, and any lever whose ISS gain is a
    memory-side effect is read on silicon before it is planned around.

59. **One PD beats two PDs for the resident FC set, and a pool-28 miss
    costs ≈ 3.5 ms where a pool-16 / -24 miss costs 0.5–0.7** (#201 S2
    one-PD sittings 1 and 2, `R3CY10WM83Y` 2026-10-01 09:43 and
    `R3CY205ZMND` 11:00, plus the two-PD sitting 2026-09-30 22:18). (a)
    With the FC set + lm_head on S1's arena beside a 28-expert pool
    (`NNTR_HTP_E2E_PDS=1`), FC + DENSE_FFN + LM_HEAD read 9.2 ms a token
    `feed=vtcm` against 11.6–13.1 on the VTCM-less S2, the 44 hops
    (≈ 0.33 ms each side) and the second wall go, `rt` 22.4 against 26.6
    (P28) / 30.6 (E0) ms: +6–9 tok/s over two PDs, +12–14 over E0, on
    both units, every text == A. #178's projection for a second session
    (45–46 tok/s) was the two-PD shape; the one-PD shape is what plan 201
    §3.4 asked for and it is the better of the two. The pool is capped by
    the PD's address space: C = 29 is the largest that loads beside the
    448 MiB FC set on the S25, C = 30 fails `fastrpc_mmap(32 MiB)`; C = 29
    gives fewer misses (0.12–0.23 a token at G ≥ 512 vs 0.17–0.34) but the
    same speed, so **C = 28 is the one-PD pool**. The FC set's ≈ 1.1 ms
    over #178's isolated 8.06 and the MoE round's 10.5 ms (0.48 a layer)
    are what is left between Q28 (≈ 22–23 ms a token) and A (≈ 18–21).
    (b) Against reasoning: a miss on the 28-pool reads **3.45 ms** (one
    PD, farm unit, profiled: 121 misses / 417 ms) and **3.79** (two PDs,
    `R3CY10WM83Y`) against 0.72 (C = 24) / 0.53 (C = 16), with the model
    file 95–100 % page-cache resident and the profiled prefetch reading
    88 / 88 experts ahead with 0.0 ms exposed wait — page-cache residency
    and the prefetch do not explain it; the bigger ION arena (3.3 GB) and
    the reader threads' placement are the next reads (㉜). At G ≥ 512 the
    28-pool misses 0.12–0.34 a token, so the cost is 0.1–1.1 ms a token,
    not the lever's ceiling. (c) Per unit, per boot, no cause: the farm
    unit stopped twice on the S1 ceiling 3584 (after a two-PD G = 512 r1
    on a 7.8-day-uptime boot and after the profiled run, both runs having
    closed clean, `chunks unmapped 13/13`), `R3CY10WM83Y` once across the
    three #201 sittings (two-PD, after `E0_G512_r1`, also a first boot) —
    read it before any S26 sitting plans its reboots (㉝). (d) The two
    units are not one column: ≈ 7 % apart in DSP clock by the farm
    session's reading (rule 34's band), yet Q28 at G = 512 read higher on
    the slower unit (44.7–46.7 vs 42.4–43.4) — the one-PD cell's spread
    across boots and prefill ramps is larger than the unit gap; read each
    sitting against its own A only. (e) The two-PD path was removed by
    #211 on 2026-10-01; its numbers stay as the reason.

60. **`HmxMmU8I4Layer.RegistryCapacity` takes the S26 developer unit
    `R3CY70LV96T` (userdebug `S948USQU1AZAB`) into Samsung download mode**
    (2026-10-01 14:12, after 16 `[ OK ]`; USB `04e8:685d`, adb gone, no
    tombstone / pstore; the four config files written seconds before came
    back zeroed — `sync` after every push on this unit). Exclude it there
    (`--gtest_filter=-HmxMmU8I4Layer.RegistryCapacity`, as
    `204/s26/run_s26.sh` now does); whether the test or the build is the
    cause is not known and was not re-tried. The S25 units and
    `R5KL20NFRCK` ran it.

61. **A boot's first ≈ 2 minutes are not measurement time: the pool
    miss read (8 `pread` slices into the ION arena, one per pinned core)
    costs 3.7–5.0 ms a miss at uptime ≲ 130 s and 0.5–1.6 ms afterwards,
    whatever the knob** (`201-s3-probe.md`, `R3CY10WM83Y` 2026-10-01
    17:27 / 17:34, two reboots, 20 profiled Q28 / Q24 G = 64 runs, every
    text == A). Against reasoning: the handoffs' "reboot, then start" put
    the first runs inside that window, and rule 59 b's 3.5–3.8 vs 0.5–0.7
    compared a C = 28 cell near a boot with C = 16 / 24 cells that were
    not. Protocol from here: **after a reboot wait ≥ 5 min, or run one
    discarded warm-up run, before the first measured run**, and record
    the uptime on every run line. The first-run cells already in the
    tables are flagged, not corrected: `201-one-pd.md` sitting 2's
    `Q28 G = 512 r1` (noted cold) and `prof_Q28` (3.45 ms), the two-PD
    sitting's 3.79 (`201-fsu-e2e.md`), and #208's `prof_Q28_q4` / `_q1`
    (4.69 / 3.99 ms on the developer S26) — that unit's "≈ 4.7 ms a miss"
    is unexplained and boot proximity is a candidate for it. The
    reader-thread knobs (`NNTR_MOE_PREFETCH_CPUS`, `_READERS`,
    `NNTR_MOE_PREFETCH=0`) do not move the decode miss (the readers run
    only in prefill; the miss is the pool server's `parallel_for`); the
    cause of the slow regime is not measured (㉜, #216).
    **Amended, cycle 30 (#216 step 1, `216-miss-read.md`): the cause is
    not boot proximity and the protocol does not remove it.** The slow
    miss is a storage read: the model file's page cache is evicted by
    kswapd *during the run* (3.3 GB ION arena + 4.1 GB file + Android on
    11.1 GB), and a re-missed expert then comes from UFS — `pgpgin` 610 /
    310 / 61 / 0 MiB in the decode window against 5.03 / 2.72 / 1.55 /
    0.55 ms/miss on one boot, PSI io 92–296 ms in every slow window.
    Slow runs happen at uptime 300 s and after a 6-minute idle; the
    uptime correlation of the two S3 sittings was that sitting's memory
    state. What stays of the protocol: the uptime on every run line, and
    **a pool-miss cell is readable only with the decode window's
    `pgpgin` (the `pgpgin_mib=` field on the pool line since PR #218) or
    PSI io next to it** — without it a ms/miss number is one draw from a
    bimodal distribution (0.68–4.38 on one boot, `216-fadvise.md`). The
    first-run cells flagged above stay flagged for this reason, not for
    their uptime.

62. **`posix_fadvise` is not a hint on this phone (S25, kernel
    6.6.77-android15): WILLNEED reads at most the device's 1 MiB
    read-ahead window of a range and costs 3–8 ms of caller time per
    5.4 MiB expert; DONTNEED costs 2–10 ms per expert** (`216-fadvise.md`
    probes, `R3CY10WM83Y` 2026-10-01; the workstation clamps the window
    at 128 KiB). Against reasoning: plan 216 rev. 2 assumed one
    asynchronous call per range at ≈ 0.1 ms. Consequences measured in the
    same sitting: issued in 128 KiB pieces on one unpinned worker, the
    advice keeps every decode miss a cache hit (0.86–1.13 ms/miss on both
    boots) but puts +0.3–0.6 ms on each miss round beside A's fast reads
    and **−7 to −18 % on the prefill**, where the drops and WILLNEEDs run
    beside the 8-thread prefill; no placement tried (inline, per-call
    threads, one worker at any priority, deferred to the decode start)
    removed the cost. `mlock` is not available either (`ulimit -l`
    64 KiB without root). A page-cache lever on this kernel must avoid
    the syscalls on the token and prefill paths: hold the bytes in a
    user buffer, or read with `O_DIRECT`, and drop the file's pages once
    at load.

63. **The engine keys' load-time Q4_0 → qs4cx-WH re-quantization of the FC
    weights is not the +4 % of doc 51 on this tree, and its ≈ 216 MiB of
    copies live in the DSP heap, which the budget must count** (#222
    closing sitting, farm `R3CY205ZMND` 2026-10-02, set from `ddb7d9ad8`;
    numbers in #222's comments, handoff unfilled). Against reasoning: plan
    222 and the handoff took doc 51's `attn_proj` +4.5 % / `dense_ffn`
    +4.2 % prefill PPL as the accepted cost and budgeted the copies only
    against the 3840 MiB map window ("≈ 200 MiB of room for 216"). The
    device: (a) with all three keys the hybrid's prefill PPL is 90.31 →
    128.31 (+42 %) and the forced decode PPL 1.2108 → 1.3752 (+13.6 %),
    the G64 text loops — two stacked quantizations (the file's Q4_0, then
    per-column qs4cx over K = 2048) are not the author's one; (b) the
    copies raise `heap_used_kib` 92 058 → 223 003, and the conv block's
    M-proportional session scratch (`hexkl_conv_block.c:268–284`, ≈ 26
    MiB at M = 1024) then fails with `AEE_ENOMEMORY` at P1024 while P512
    still fits; (c) one PD + pool C = 28 (3328 mapped) + the 448 MiB Q4M1
    FC set + the copies reaches `mapped=3712` and the FC set's last 32 MiB
    `fastrpc_mmap` fails — the "room" was never there once the heap is
    counted. Consequence: a weight that the HTP reads at prefill and at
    decode is stored **once, in a file, in the DSP's format** (#225: the
    `QS4CX_WH` FC sidecar written by the packer from f32, PR #230; no
    load-time re-quantization, the heap keeps scratch only), the prefill
    runs in 512-row chunks (PR #230, the hybrid's way of record), a config
    / feature that adds DSP-heap bytes is read at P1024 as well as P512
    before it is adopted, and a one-PD budget sums pool + FC set + heap
    copies + scratch against 3840.

64. **A prefill FC call the HTP runs is chunked by `fcMaxRows(K)` (VTCM
    arithmetic: 1920 rows at K = 2048), not by PR #230's 512-row
    `prefillRows()`, so the hybrid's attention qkv projection at
    P1024 reaches the DSP as one M = 1024 call — and that call fails
    `AEE_ERPC` (`0x80000600`) when the FC WH overflow sits on the DSP
    heap, while the identical call succeeds with the heap empty** (#225
    handoff, farm `R3CY205ZMND` 2026-10-06, set from `51b2b4477`; log
    `nntr_hvx_mm_u8i4_layer failed: err=-2147482112 (M=1024 K=2048
    N=3072 handles=3)` after `[HTP] fc wh: … arena_kib=145408
    heap_kib=75776 requant=0`). Against reasoning: plan 225 and the
    handoff expected the hybrid's P1024 to hold because "P1024 now runs
    in 512-row chunks, so the conv block's scratch is the P512 size" —
    true of the conv block, the dense FFN and the MoE prefill
    (`htp_compute_ops.cpp:4558`, `:5412`), not of the FC entries
    (`gemm_q4_0_accel_fp32` `:1262–1272`, `gemm_q4_0_batch_fp32`
    `:1333–1345`, which is the qkv `handles=3` call) that keep their own
    cap; and the failure is `AEE_ERPC`, not #222's `AEE_ENOMEMORY` — the
    DSP side rejects the call rather than failing an allocation, which
    the host cannot tell apart from a stale skel without the banner
    (rule 38). Measured beside it, as the plan predicted: the hybrid's
    overflow `heap_kib=75776` (plan 72–86 MiB) is real and is the
    difference between B (fails) and Q (`heap_kib=0`, runs the same
    M = 1024 keys at P1024: 699–755 tok/s prefill); the E2E one PD with
    the WH FC set fits at C = 28 (mapped 192 + 3520 = 3712 of 3840,
    `heap_used_kib` 94 604). Consequences: every HTP prefill entry a
    config key can route (conv, dense, MoE **and the FCs**) obeys one
    row cap, `prefillRows()`; a chunked path is proven bit-identical to
    the unchunked one on the host before the device sees it (PR #230's
    `CONV BLOCK CHUNKED BIT-IDENTICAL` is the template); and a hybrid
    cell with a non-zero `heap_kib` is read at P1024 before it is
    adopted — until the FC chunk lands, the hybrid's P1024 case of record
    is Bfb (attention / dense keys `cpu`, conv `htp`; user decision (b)).

65. **The pool-miss slow regime is page-cache eviction and nothing else:
    take the model file out of the page cache once (the 88-expert
    complement in a cached ARM tier, `O_DIRECT` reads, one whole-file
    `DONTNEED` at load) and it is gone — window refaults 74k–153k →
    ≤ 571, kswapd scan 65k–139k/s → 0, PSI io 81–176 → 19–37 ms,
    `resident after` 0.7–3.2 GiB → 0, ms/miss 2.05–8.11 → 0.43–0.83 on
    every tiered run of three boots (#219, farm `R3CY205ZMND`
    2026-10-06, 42 runs). Three things the device said against the
    plan:** (a) **the one-thread copy beats the 8-slice `parallel_for`
    copy on every axis** — 0.43–0.45 vs 0.51–0.83 ms a miss, decode
    48.47 (sd 0.23) vs 47.31 (0.71) over four interleaved runs,
    refaults ≤ 81 vs up to 6236, `pswpin` ≤ 168 vs 2105, prefill +1.7 vs
    +0.7 % — plan 219 expected the 8-slice memcpy at 22–26 GB/s
    (≈ 0.25 ms for 5.3 MiB); measured, the 8-slice copy is 0.67 ms
    (≈ 8 GB/s) and one thread 0.44 (≈ 12 GB/s): a store into an uncached
    ION slot is store-bound, and the eight slices' barrier and their
    contention with the DSP's own DRAM traffic cost more than the
    parallelism gives. (b) **`tier_waits` 3–4 a run at every G (103 /
    120 / 124 misses) means the refill is not fully off the token path
    — but the count does not grow with G, so it is the decode start's
    backlog (the prefill batch's victims still refilling when the first
    tokens miss; the host's `run_inproc_e2e.sh` showed the same 2 waits
    at decode start behind `refill_ms=42.5`), not a steady-state race;
    the lever is to drain the refill queue before the first decode
    token, not a second refill thread. (c) **`pswpin` is not 0 with the
    tier** (0–1261 on the main sitting, up to 2105 / `pswpout` 3621 on
    one `=1` run; `=2` ≤ 168 / 12): anon 766 + tier 467 MiB beside the
    3 776 MiB of ION arenas puts the sum at the edge of the S25's 11 114
    MiB, and the kernel swaps a little (zram) — rule 61's memory
    arithmetic holds with the page cache replaced by the tier, with
    ≈ 0.5 GiB less headroom than the plan assumed. Consequence: a miss
    on this phone is a memcpy, never a read, from now on; G2's `pgpgin`
    is the refills alone (misses × 5.29 MiB ± 7); the E2E Q28 cell's
    largest term at G 64 (3–8 ms a token, ㉜) is ≤ 0.9 ms a token with
    `=2`; what is left between Q28 (48.5) and the CPU (52–54) at that
    cell is no longer the miss. Default not flipped — the user's call
    (#219, as #218).

66. **A skel that was built before an IDL change in the base is stale
    for an app built after it, even when the branch under test changed
    no DSP source — "no DSP change on this branch" is not the test;
    `git diff <skel's commit>..HEAD -- test/htp/nntr_hvx.idl` is** (#236
    close-out, 2026-10-06: the handoff planned to reuse the #225 skels
    `58e3a85f…` / `ca25ec2d…` because `htp/236-qkv-chunks` touches the
    host only, but the #237 sync had brought #232's IDL change into
    the base under it; the stub compiled into `libnntrainer.so` and the
    reused skel would have disagreed — on the device that reads as
    `0x8000040e` (the runner's STOP condition, rule 38's class), not as
    a wrong answer). The set ran with skels rebuilt at `a3d966164`
    against the current IDL (v79 `ce4e6486…`, v81 `adfd44d4…`), the
    staged `md5.txt` was regenerated (`1e6bf2f0…`) and the device md5s
    equal the regenerated set — a rule-22 case, accepted. Consequence:
    a handoff that copies a skel from an earlier set states the skel's
    source commit and the IDL diff against the app's commit (empty, or
    rebuild); the supervisor voids a run whose skel predates an IDL
    change in the app's history; `build.sh` is still not
    bit-reproducible (rule 14: a second v79 build at the same commit
    gave `b5f04afe…`), so skel identity is "built at commit X against
    IDL Y", never an md5 match across machines.

67. **With the tier on, the E2E one PD's G64 cell is still under the CPU
    at every prompt length, and its residual scales with P: misses/token
    × the tier copy plus a decode-start cost — 1.16 / 1.61 / 2.62
    misses a token (`miss_wait_us/token` 157 / 317–331 / 472–475) and a
    one-off ≈ 45 / 77 / 160 ms a run at P64 / P512 / P1024, so the G64
    cell sits 0.8 / 1.5 / 3.0 ms a token behind the same P's G512 cell
    and −3.4 / −7.7 / −7.5 % under the CPU, while at G ≥ 512 the same
    path reads 50.6–54.6, ≥ 50 and above the CPU at every P** (#219
    close-out, `R3CY205ZMND` 2026-10-06, 14 runs; Q 52.20 / 54.60 /
    53.89, 48.08 / 51.79 / 51.65, 44.02 / 50.59 / 50.78 vs the CPU of
    record 54.05 / 52.54 / 51.48, 52.07 / 50.70 / 49.47, 47.58 / 48.82 /
    47.41). Against reasoning: plan 219 and the cycle-35b fold treated
    the pool miss as *the* G64 term and expected the tier (ms/miss 3 →
    0.44) to close that cell; it moved it +12 … +22 % over the untiered
    Q, but the miss wait is now only 0.14–0.41 ms a token of the gap —
    the rest is a start cost that grows with P (the prefill batch's
    victims still refilling when decode starts: `tier_waits` 0 / 3 / 3
    at P64 / P512 / P1024, constant across G, rule 65 b; plus the first
    token's own work) and is paid once a run, so G amortises it (÷ 64
    vs ÷ 512). Consequence: the G64 column of an E2E row is read as
    "start cost ÷ G + misses × copy", not as a per-token rate; a lever
    for it drains the refill queue before the first decode token (㊴ 2)
    or keeps the prefill batch from evicting the pool, and is gated on
    the G64 cell *at P1024* (the worst case), not at P512; the hybrid
    (resident experts, no pool) has no such term and stays the fastest
    configuration at every cell (56.4–56.5 at P512 G64 in both
    close-out sittings). Not pursued on LFM2.5 (user: the E2E speed gap
    is closed here, re-examined on Gemma).

68. **The hybrid's P1024 failure beside the FC WH heap overflow is the
    FC call's row count, not the overflow's residency: the same
    `heap_kib=75776` overflow with every M > 1 FC call capped at 512
    rows loads and runs P1024 at every G, the unchunked set fails
    deterministically in the same sitting (`0x80000600` on the first
    attention qkv call, A′ P1024 VOID), and the chunking costs ≈ 0 in
    decode and ≈ 3.4 % of the prefill** (#236 close-out, `R3CY205ZMND`
    2026-10-06: B P1024 53.24 / 53.06 / 48.64 = Bfb's 52.03 / 51.51 /
    48.74 anchored (the M = 1 path is untouched), prefill 725.7 / 722.7 /
    711.1 = +9.4 / +11.1 / +9.5 % over Bfb (which ran those FCs on the
    CPU); `prof_B_P1024`: `M>1 FC K=2048 N=3072` 12 calls / 6144 rows,
    `N=2048` 13 / 6656, 2.31 / 1.61 ms host a call with 0.60 / 0.37 ms
    transport and `rest` 39–41 % of host (quant 0.42 + acc 0.19–0.29
    ms), 48.8 ms of a 1458 ms profiled prefill). Against reasoning: plan
    236 priced the extra calls at ≈ 0.4 ms each (≈ 5 ms, 0.3 %); on the
    device an FC chunk is 1.6–2.3 ms of host time — the DSP work is
    1.2–1.7 ms (77 / 74 % of host) and the per-call `quant` / `acc` /
    transport ≈ 1 ms, ten times the plan's figure — yet still small
    beside the 1.4 s prefill, so the plan's "chunking is free" verdict
    stands at the prefill gate (+9 % over Bfb, floors 630 / 618 / 617
    passed) while its per-call arithmetic does not. The o_proj row's
    13th call (6656 = 6144 + 512 rows) is the host fixture's extra
    call, read as expected; `heap_kib` stayed 75776 on every B run, so
    the arena tails were filled as in #225 and the overflow itself is
    sound with 512-row calls. Consequence: every HTP prefill entry a
    config key can route obeys `prefillRows()` (rule 64's consequence,
    now measured); a per-call cost on the DSP side is read from a
    profile row, never from the plan's µs/call; Bfb (attention / dense
    keys `cpu`) is no longer the hybrid's P1024 case of record — B is.

| ② Transport floor (wall 3) | **marshalling**: 527.7 µs/call at level 3 vs 587.7 at level 2 (−10 %, inside ±15 %; wake/clock would have been ≤ 300), `qos_mode` 2 both. **Refined by the #88 plan (host inventory, not yet measured):** cache maintenance on the over-sized staging pair (decode's 8 KiB rode a 4 MiB cached ION pair after prompt 512; 36–59 µs/MB, doc 50 §3.6) plus the 100 µs poll-window fallback to the interrupt path; the per-call arguments proper are 464 non-ION bytes (48 B primitive block + 5 sequences) and cannot carry 500 µs. Fix taken first = upstream `fb0f02b9` + `04a2fcc4` + `b0a384d6` (PR #103); prebind is conditional on that measurement (plan 88 §3.3 / §4 step 5); dspqueue / resident worker deferred to one paragraph (#83 §4). **Confirmed and closed by #88's sitting: staging 245.8 µs + poll 67.6 µs of A's 401.3; see ⑦ below** | #77 B; plan 88 §2.1; #88 |

So the feed half is the lever. The one-row loop is what lets a VTCM feed hide the compute (240 ≪ 600 rather than 590 ≈ 600) (rule 26). **Merge verdict (cycle 9): hold.** As-is, the default lead is 64 KB = B2, a measured decode regression at all three G. Flipped to 192 KB (B3) it is neutral, not a gain, and the flip is a code change (no implementer this cycle). Once the weights stream from VTCM the `l2fetch` lead has nothing to prefetch, so the lead question dissolves if #100 certifies a feed shape. The PR's lasting content is the one-row loop, the x86 HVX-emulation check (`gemv_native_check.c`) and the microbench. The ㉒ feed issue takes them over by rebasing onto #107 and measuring feed + one-row together. If #100's feed verdict fails (no shape ≥ 37 GB/s beside HVX), the fallback is to land #107 with the lead at ≥ 192 KB after a sweep (384 KB + L2 budget). That fallback is filed only then. **Also read:** the GEMV path's M==1 transport is 182–184 µs here vs #88 B's 87.9 on the GEMV-off path.

## 3. Open items (candidates for issues; the supervisor promotes them)

| # | item | expected | depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| ① | ~~Measurement A~~ **measured (#77) → §2.** Follow-on: the dense FC's 28.2 ms/token on the NPU path is the second-largest lever after MoE; **it is not a round-trip cost** (no FC is on the HTP in that config, §2 correction) — see ⑰ | — | ⑰ |
| ⑱ | **Measured by #95 on the side tree `htp_hadamard` → §2 (cycle 8): carry it over. PPL −12.7 % (100.5 vs A 115.1, CPU 109.8), requant SNR median +8.0 dB, cost +2.7 % / +0.3 % of the M>1 / M==1 `dsp=`, decode inside drift. #95 closed. Remainder filed as #110 (p2, `state:needs-plan`):** (a) `fwht_det.h` drops its FTZ (rule 24); (b) the synthetic SNR assertion becomes a printed field (rule 25); (c) port to `htp_moe` with the M=1 GEMV requant site (about `:509`), plus the HMX block loop (about `:1415`) and the tail (about `:370`); the HAD opts bit must not clear PR #108's default-on GEMV bit; (d) `NNTR_PPL` as a separate upstream cherry-pick (`32b46e32`, user decision at merge). Gate = an `htp_moe` handoff: B ≡ A (text + PPL), C PPL ≤ A, SNR median ≥ B + 5 dB, M==1 `dsp=` ≤ +2 %, prefill −5 %. p2 because it does not move decode tok/s; it becomes p1 if the user adopts PPL as the accuracy column for `QS4CX_WH*` models. History: **Accuracy, filed as #95 (p1):** Hadamard rotation on the MoE down_proj input — fold `Hᵀ·W_down` offline (new dtype `QS4CX_WH_HAD`, block 256, 1792 = 7 × 256, 1/16 both sides), FWHT-256 in IEEE `sf` add/sub on the DSP right before the existing u8 requant at all three requant sites of `hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c`. Targets the recorded gap (doc 43, 2026-09-09: 5 of 32 MoE calls at 67–80 dB SNR, each from exactly one of 1792 elements crossing a u8 level — boundary rounding, not row outliers; column-wise outliers never measured). **First accuracy item in this table**; it does not move tok/s by design and may show no effect — a "no effect" result closes it with the numbers. Gate = `NNTR_L2_DIFF` per-call SNR / `total_flips` on vs off on the 5 recorded calls + full-model handoff with prefill/decode TPS and text-identical-to-CPU; prefill gate applies (it touches the weight layout and the requant stage). Rules that bind: no qf32 (v75/v79), host scalar `fwht_rows_f32_ref` bit-identical to the HVX kernel, CPU `QS4CX` run stays the reference (no CPU kernel for `_HAD`, rule 6 applies to it too) | requant SNR on the 5 bad calls ↑; text-identical-to-CPU unchanged or better; TPS within noise | none; can run in parallel with the walls (touches quantizer + requant only) |

| ③ | ~~Measurement C~~ **measured (#77) → shape only; in-situ gap is the wall → ⑥ / #87** | — | — |
| ④ | **CLOSED (cycle 22) by #90 (PR #156): DRAM ≈ 70 GB/s aggregate for any reader mix, rule 44; §2 #90 row.** Two-reader DDR probe — **DSP side invalid in #77 (rule 12); refiled as #90** (stream > VTCM+L2 or use the DMA ring, bounded result). CPU side: −41 % under contention, so any split pays less than the sum | decides whether the CPU+NPU split (contract §3.2) can ever pay | #90, ride-along step in a later sitting |
| ⑤ | **Filed as #80.** M=1 MoE path on the existing HVX GEMV (wall 1). The kernel already exists: `hvx/hvx_gemm_u8i4_wh.c` (u8×i4 over WH tiles, int32 bit-identical to HMX, m ≤ 16) is used only by the prefill "tail" path in `hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c` (off by default, net −0.5 ms there). Decode needs a dispatch that sends all four experts through it at M=1 with no 64-row block, plus the weight feed (arena read vs DMA into VTCM) that ③ decides | MoE DSP 1.35 → ≈ 0.3 ms/call if DMA ≥ 30 GB/s | ③ |
| ⑥ | **Loose end read by #113's ride-along (cycle 12): 724.0 µs / 31.2 GB/s = #100, not #94 — rule 32; the feed half does not re-open at 37, it re-files at 31.6 vs 23.5 (㉒). Nothing left in ⑥.** **CLOSED as a descriptor-list question, 2026-09-23 by #100 (§2 row): row h dissolves.** Against the tag-validated `c_star` the traced 46-descriptor list runs at **1.19 ×**, i.e. faster than the ceiling; rules 11 and 19 are amended/withdrawn (rule 28) and there is no list-side loss to fix. The 16–18 GB/s in-situ number stays real, but its cause is the interleaving (rows f + g, ≈ 20 % of `dsp_us`) plus an engine that tops out near 31 GB/s on every validated per-call cell — **not a shape or a list**. The GEMV path bypasses the ring entirely (`desc=2/call`), so at M=1 nothing in ⑥ is on the decode critical path any more; rows f and g are **not** filed. What wall 2 leaves behind at M=1 is the read-rate half, which lives in ㉒ and #113. **One loose end, a ride-along not an issue:** re-read `DMA_REPLAY workers=1 load=0 pace=0` on the next sitting and see whether it returns to #94's 561.5 µs / 40.2 GB/s (rule 30); if it does, the `f2` feed cell would clear 37.0 and ㉒'s feed half re-opens. History: **Wall 2 — measured by #94 sitting 2 (§2 attribution): the 4–7× is ≈ 2.7× in the traced chunk list itself (row h, rule 19, provisional on #99) and ≈ 1.3–1.8× in the interleaving (f + g ≈ 20 % of `dsp_us`). Step 2 filed as #100 (row h: why the 46-descriptor / 32-region list replays at 40 GB/s where probe iii does 107; gate = replay ≥ 80 % of probe iii and in-situ `engine GB/s` ≥ 40; blocked by #99 until the replay's content check is explained). Rows f and g follow #100.** **Cycle 9: #100 re-scoped to plan 100 §0 (row h's cause + a DDR → VTCM feed shape certified ≥ 37 GB/s beside HVX for ㉒, same-run `c_star` denominator), raised to p0 after #105, no longer blocked by #99 (new cells set their dst mode explicitly).** History: rewritten by #77 C — not descriptor / engine / vote but "why does the MoE call see a quarter of the isolated rate". Step 1 = ~~#87~~ **landed on `htp_moe` as `b6ebc2b7` (PR #93, 2026-09-22; #87 closed)**: `hmx/hexkl_dma_trace.{c,h}` (static tables, union-of-intervals busy / depth / blocked-wait arithmetic, host-checked by `dma_trace_host_check`), trace hooks in `hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c` behind `hexkl_probe_on` (byte-identical output on vs off, 19 descriptors traced at the fixture shape, 46 at the LFM2 M=1 shape), IDL entries `dma_probe` / `moe_dma_trace_read` / `dma_replay` (`test/htp/nntr_hvx_dma_probe.c`), the header-only in-situ descriptor plan `test/htp/nntr_moe_dma_plan.h`, the second `weight DMA:` line and the `[HTP-DMA]` per-descriptor dump in `[HTP-PROFILE]` (`htp_compute_ops.cpp`, first `NNTR_HTP_DMA_TRACE` calls, default 3), and `TEST_F(HvxDmaProbe, MoeChunkReplay)` (workers 1/2/4 × HVX load × fresh/gap) in `unittest_hvx_dma_probe`. **The device sitting that fills the attribution table (plan 87 §1, hypotheses a–g) is #94 (sitting 2); its first attempt never reached the NPU because the trace's own `hexkl_dma_trace.c` was missing from the skel build (#97, rule 17).** Original scope for reference: instrument the ring use inside `hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c` (per-descriptor issue/complete pcycles, wait time in `hexkl_dma_ring_wait`, outstanding depth, actual chunk shapes at M=1 and M>1) + a device gtest that reproduces the in-situ pattern, gate = a table attributing the 4–7× to named causes. Step 2 = the fix that table names (separate issue).

Wall 3 is no longer the lever (1.9 ms/token left); the MoE call is 94 % DSP, so walls 1–2 own most of the remaining 2.1× to 50 tok/s. #88 and #83 (the transport-options document, consumed by plan 88) closed in cycle 7. **Left open, not an issue:** whether the GEMV path's +100 µs transport of #94 C (649 → 748) survives the new staging — #101's ride-along reads it as the same-sitting A (GEMV default) − A0 (`NNTR_MOE_HTP_M1_GEMV=0`) level-2 M==1 transport (`101-ride-along.md` R2/R4, rule 23). **Cycle 11: ANSWERED in-sitting by #100's A/A0 (§2 row). GEMV 185.8 vs HMX 84.6 µs/call, Δ +101.2 (2.20 ×), equal `act`/`out` classes (65536 B), one sitting, one binary — so the +100 µs is path cost and it survives PR #103's staging. It is not a defect to chase: the same A/B wins 343 µs of `dsp` and 242 of `host`. The 4.1 ms/token it costs comes back only with ⑨ (one call per token), not with a transport fix; no issue.** **Cycle 15: wrong — it came back with the VTCM feed (rule 35): B's M==1 transport 82.0 / 92.3 µs vs A's 184.6 / 190.3 in the same sitting, so the +100 µs was the direct HVX arena read's, and transport at the feed default is ≈ 2.0 ms/token, the HMX-path level of ⑦.** Earlier, cycle 9: #105's A reads M==1 transport 182–184 µs against #88 B's 87.9 (GEMV off), which is cross-sitting (rule 23) and consistent with it surviving. At ≈ 2 ms/token it is worth an A/B line; PR #108 merged (`8e121dbe`) without a sitting, so that line (`101-ride-along.md` R2/R4) rides #100's handoff. dspqueue / resident worker: one paragraph (plan 83 §4), revisited only with ⑨.

Its transport half is done without it (#141, rule 40: 22 × 14 µs = 0.3 ms/token), so ⑨'s ≈ −5 ms is no longer an open target: what is left outside the MoE call is ⑰ / #150 (the CPU GEMV rate, rule 42). #132 PR 2 and #146 are `needs-user`; `NNTR_PPL_DECODE` (#134) stays as a tool. **Cycle 20 close: landed PR #143 (pool race fix; #136 closed as not-a-defect, rule 39 / §2), PR #144 (`NNTR_PPL_DECODE`, #134), PR #145 (ADD + ROUTER_TOPK, #132 PR 1: 95 → 73 → 51). B's six-kind verdict now reads from the decode PPL against A of the same sitting (+2 %), next to the text column and the approval. Next device read: the combined #134 / #132 sitting staged at `/local/mnt/workspace/htp_moe/134-132/` (A switch off / C `KINDS=MOE` / B six kinds / D six + ADD + ROUTER_TOPK). The two terms ⑨ must still cut are the call count (51 → 1: #132 PR 2, held behind #141's transport microbench) and ATTN_M1's per-position cost (㉗ = #146).** **D mask (#132 PR 1, host-gated, cycle 20): `NNTR_HTP_FORWARD_KINDS=MOE,RMSNORM,QK_NORM,ROPE,CONV1D_GATE,ATTN_M1,ADD,ROUTER_TOPK` → 51 calls/token on LFM2.5 (host fixtures: hd8 7, hd64 8, lfm25 15; + ADD alone 9 / 10 / 19 by the same count); the default mask stays the six kinds. Device cell rides the combined sitting with #134's decode PPL.** **MEASURED ON SILICON (cycle 19, #130's sitting → §2): the entry is free (C ≡ A), the wired six-kind set costs −22 / −25 / −30 % at 95 calls/token and its text degenerates (user `n`). #135 done (the app never carried `ENABLE_HEXKL`, rule 36; the export is committed, no device cell — #136's sitting is its first device use). Open, in order: #136 (B's text: kind-by-kind bisect with `NNTR_HTP_FORWARD_KINDS` on silicon, ㉕), then ㉓ / #132; ㉗ (ATTN_M1 ≈ 1.05 µs/position/layer) is the other term. #130 closed.** **WIRED (cycle 18, #130's PR, host-gated): `hexkl_graph.c`'s table = MOE \| RMSNORM \| QK_NORM \| ROPE \| CONV1D_GATE \| ATTN_M1 (wire v2: `n_kv` / `gqa` / `head_dim` / `eps_bits` in the op record, the kernels' shape rules in the validator as `AEE_ESCHEMENOTSUPPORTED`, ATTN_M1-needs-ROPE as `AEE_ENOTALLOWED`); parameters bound once through `graph_set_param` (gammas, conv weights, conv state seed, RoPE table); the four CPU layers call one hook at a decode row (`htp_decode_hook.h`), the KV cache is registered at `graph_init` and seeded from the CPU prefill's rows once, the conv state per layer lives on the DSP after the first routed token. Host gate on both fixtures (`INPROC E2E PASS`): hd8 with MOE,RMSNORM,CONV1D_GATE = **11 calls/token**, hd64 with all six = **12**, the switch-off runs untouched; `NNTR_HTP_FORWARD_KINDS=MOE` reproduces plan 85's B. On LFM2.5 the same arithmetic gives **95 calls/token with all six kinds on, 22 with `KINDS=MOE`** — a per-op residency without adjacency to the MoE op *raises* the call count (§2 verdict); the device cost is the ride-along's (plan 130 §4 step 7, under the accuracy rule below). The count falls below 22 only with ㉓ (#132). Measured on the host: CONV1D_GATE bit-identical to the CPU path, RMSNORM 129 dB, the attention kinds 39 dB at worst (fp16 KV rows on the CPU vs f32 on the DSP, through two activation quantizers on 128-wide rows), tokens 8/8; the gate's floor is 30 dB.** **USER DECISION 2026-09-28 (cycle 18): the accuracy column for the ⑨ handoffs is (a) + (b) + approval — keep text-identical-to-CPU as a column, add `NNTR_PPL` vs the CPU `q40` PPL (upstream `32b46e32` is on `htp_moe` since PR #121), and add a user approval step: the filled handoff pastes each variant's generated text, the user marks `text approved: y/n`, and only approved rows are folded (contract §1 accuracy gate, `hexagon-handoff` skill).

The cheap half is that **the feed is DDR latency, not bandwidth** (rule 26), and the only lever measured against it is monotonic and unsaturated: `l2fetch` lead 0 / 64 / 192 KB = 145.2 / 137.5 / 120.2 ns/tile. #105 confounded the lead with the loop shape — A is four-row with a zero-lead self-prefetch, B1/B2/B3 are one-row with lead 0/64/192 — so **the four-row loop has never been measured with any lead at all**. Filed as **#113 (p0)**: complete the 2 × N matrix, sweep past 192 KB, cross the expert boundary, land the winner (which decides PR #107's default and whether #107 lands at all). Gate `mm` ≤ 840 µs at M==1 (−13.7 % vs #100 A_L2's 980.9). **#114 (p1)** carries the next-expert / cross-op prefetch. The feed half stays open but unfiled, behind ⑥'s ride-along. Earlier: **Cycle 9: compute half measured (#105 → §2): gate failed. The best loop (one-row + 192 KB lead) gives `mm` 930.9 vs 973.0 (−4.3 %). The feed is ≈ 74 % of `mm` under that loop and ≈ 37 % under the four-row one. The feed half is the lever. It needs #107's loop to hide the compute: ≈ 240 µs vs the ≈ 590 the four-row loop leaves. PR #107 is held, and the feed issue rebases onto it. Order: #100 certifies a DDR → VTCM descriptor shape (≥ 37 GB/s beside HVX). Then the ㉒ feed issue is filed with that shape, gated `mm` ≤ 600 at M==1, text = A, prefill −5 %, and its A/B measures feed + one-row loop against A. If #100 certifies nothing, land #107 with a lead sweep (≥ 192 KB) and close ㉒ at what the arena allows.** Earlier: **Split (user direction, cycle 6, 2026-09-22). Compute side filed as #105 (p0, `state:needs-plan`):** one-row `gemm_rows1` at `m = 1` (drops `gemm_rows4`'s three dead accumulators; accumulation order unchanged, so int32 stays bit-identical to the HMX), `l2fetch` lead / distance, and the lane split over the pool. It needs no ring, so it does not wait for #100. The handoff sets `NNTR_MOE_HTP_M1_GEMV=1` explicitly in A and B, which keeps it independent of #101. **Feed side (remainder, not yet an issue):** VTCM staging of each expert's `wh_bytes` by DMA (two linear descriptors per expert); it must not re-import row h's slow list, so it is filed once #100 names h's cause. Evidence: C's `mm` 783 → 975 µs, a direct arena read at ≈ 22.6 GB/s effective, lane-bound (`swiglu / mm = 5.75`; plan 101 §3.4). Supervisor's estimate, not measured: the dead `vrmpy` are ~50–100 µs of the 975, and `hvx_impl` #59 measured direct DDR vector reads at 21–25 GB/s against 37 through the ring. So #105 alone may stop above 600; its ride-along microbench (arena vs VTCM copy × 4-acc vs 1-acc) sizes the feed half.

(2) Bit-exactness is harder than the proposal assumed: the ARM kernel (`nntr_gemv_q4_0_4x8_q8_0`, `nntr_ggml_impl_neon.cpp`) accumulates `acc = vfmaq_f32(acc, vcvtq_n_f32_s32(sumi, 4), d_a · d_w)` — a **fused** multiply-add per block, which HVX `sf` arithmetic (separate multiply and add, qf32 intermediates) does not have, so each block's epilogue needs an emulated single-rounding FMA, plus the q8_0 activation quantizer's scalar `1/d` and its rounding mode; which kernel runs at M=1 on the phone (4x8 i8mm vs 4x4 dotprod) also fixes the per-row block order the DSP must copy. **What would make it an issue:** a DSP read path above the CPU's in-decode FC rate (not in sight: the anchor is 37.3), or #150 showing the CPU's M=1 GEMV far below 33 GB/s — then the plan starts with the byte-rate breakdown and a host `_det` spec of the NEON epilogue (FMA included).

Options: (a) build the two-session E2E plan anyway (needs an HVX quantizer, an HVX CPU-exact router, and either VTCM for S2 or an L2 feed at the K=2048 rate for K=7168 ≈ −1 ms); (c) of #132 (keep the FCs on the CPU, one call per token only for the DSP-resident kinds — the hybrid stays the product path); or the §3.5 fallback.

The slow miss (3.7–5.0 ms) is a UFS read of a re-missed expert whose file pages kswapd evicted during the run; the fast one (0.5–1.1) is the same `pread` from the page cache. Memory: arena 3 328 + FC 448 + RSS 766 MiB unreclaimable, the model file 4 116 cached (every resident expert held twice), Android ≈ 3 740, on 11 114 MiB.** Ruled out, in order: page-cache residency *before* the run (`201-fsu-e2e.md`; it is evicted during), arena / pool size as a cure (C = 24 is 512 MiB less pressure), reader-thread placement (readers run only in prefill), a busy core on the 8-pinned-slice barrier (busiest non-app core 3–16 %), boot proximity (slow at uptime 300 s and after a 6-min idle). Measured lever (PR #218, `NNTR_MOE_FADVISE=1`, env-only, not flipped): misses 0.86–1.13 ms on every run of both boots, decode +10 / +15 % at G = 64, but the advice costs 2–10 ms a call on this kernel and **prefill −7 to −18 %** — gate fail; the `=2` cell shows pure dropping makes every miss a storage read (102 / 102 re-misses in the S0-trace replay, 121 on the device). At G ≥ 512 the pool misses 0.12–0.34 a token, so even the slow regime is ≤ 1.7 ms a token there; at G = 64 (1.89 misses a token) it is 3–8 ms a token, the largest single term between Q28 (43) and A (54) on that cell.

For S5 and its levers: every Gemma row records peak RSS and the arena bytes (`mapped=` line, pool C, FC set, cache bytes) so the later stage starts from measured numbers.

## 3a. Guide and tooling notes

* **#132 PR 1 (cycle 20): rungs 0–3 on the workstation** at the PR head — skel `b000b0cd91f6274acba6a9873a6bfd5d` (`UNDEFINED SYMBOLS OK (46 runtime imports)`; not bit-reproducible, rule above), `libcausallm_core.so` `3e06d3b08f1443b59d1ead3e4aa754cf`, `nntrainer_causallm` `75e61732f02bb243fb4b5ca2f01a09d4`, `libnntrainer.so` `aea9a50abc9b34d51676c8fc6bac1c3f`, `libccapi-nntrainer.so` `eba2f98d64939341db99a5d82d5825d9`, `unittest_hvx_softmax` `25bec7dfd9f5b342783ec59cc7d5059d` (carries `HvxM1Ops.RouterTopkMatchesDetBitExact`). The IDL gained one test method, so the stub and skel go together (rule 3).

* **#130's sitting (cycle 19): the first recorded post-#121 skel md5** is
  `ca1f2aac4985b7799897de2dcb4c2d1e` (`test/htp/build.sh` @ `9deea6e2`,
  `HEXKL_SDK_VER=6.4.0.1`, `UNDEFINED SYMBOLS OK (46 runtime imports)`;
  BENCHMARK artifacts). **Rebuild recipe since #135 (rule 36):**
  `build_android.sh --htp` carries the define (the prebuilt `Android.mk`
  exports it, `jni/meson.build`); a pre-#135 `builddir` needs one
  `(cd builddir && ninja install)` (or a build without `--cache`) first,
  since `--cache` keeps the old installed `Android.mk` — the script's
  own check (`strings libcausallm_core.so | grep -c
  NNTR_HTP_FORWARD_KINDS` >= 1 with `--htp`, 0 without) exits 1 on the
  stale one. The staged set of PR #133 (`80452a28…` skel etc.) has no
  live switch and must not be re-used for a B/C cell.

* **#130's PR (cycle 18): rungs 0–2 on the workstation** — `run_host_checks.sh`
  `ALL CHECKS PASS` / `GRAPH CHECKS PASS` / `GRAPH STRETCH BIT-IDENTICAL`,
  `run_inproc_e2e.sh` `INPROC E2E PASS`, `test/htp/build.sh` `UNDEFINED
  SYMBOLS OK (46 runtime imports)`. Two notes for the next handoff: (1)
  `build.sh`'s skel is **not bit-reproducible** (three consecutive builds
  of one tree gave three md5s), so a recorded skel md5 identifies a build,
  not a source state — the PR body says which build it is; (2) the committed
  goldens of `test/htp/host/golden/` were cut on the container (PR #127) and
  failed on the workstation on the very first MoE input (128 dB, the
  README's "this machine's CPU path differs" case) before any change of
  #130; with the container path reverted (PR #124 reverted) they are now
  cut on the workstation, and a golden mismatch on another host means that
  host, not the HTP path.

* **`docs/htp_moe/guide/`** exists since PR #92 (`cffcec3e`, merged
  `750428e8`, 2026-09-22): five self-contained English pages
  (`index`, `01-run-it`, `02-decode-path`, `03-performance`,
  `04-glossary`), decode only. The guide writer refreshes it on every
  filled handoff and every merged kernel/app PR (contract §8 step 4); its
  numbers are copied from BENCHMARK.md, never measured.
* Guide-writer findings folded into this ledger: (a) the FC 28.2 vs 10.3
  ms/token question (§2 ① correction, ⑰); (b)
  `Applications/CausalLM/install_android.sh` takes **no `--model`
  argument** in this tree — it pushes binaries and prints the `adb push`
  of a model dir as a hint (`install_android.sh:268–279`); handoffs must
  spell out the model push themselves (#77's did).
* **Rebuilding a handoff set on a fresh checkout (#105 run notes, cycle 9;
  rule 22):** four gaps the recipes did not state, now in the
  `hexagon-gates` skill rung 3. (1) A new `git worktree` has **empty
  `subprojects/`**. `build_android.sh` then dies on `iniparser.h` after
  ≈ 15 min. Run `git submodule update --init --depth 1` (or copy the
  populated dirs) first. (2) `Applications/CausalLM/lib/libtokenizers_android_c.a`
  is per-checkout. Copy it or rebuild it with `build_tokenizer_android.sh`.
  (3) `libc++_shared.so` may not appear under `jni/obj/local/arm64-v8a/`.
  Take it from the NDK r30 sysroot
  (`toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/sysroot/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-android/`,
  md5 `b1586b9b…`). (4) `HEXKL_ROOT` differs between workstations. Export
  it explicitly next to `HEXKL_SDK_VER=6.4.0.1`, and never rely on
  `env.sh`'s default path.
* **Mac client (cycle 16, contract §4.1a):** only rungs 0–1 run on the
  Mac (`tools/docker/run.sh`, HexKL beta1 mounted; the tree needs beta.2
  for the skel). A PR opened from the Mac says in its body that rungs 2–3
  were not run; the workstation produces the skel/app md5s before any
  handoff. The GitHub MCP server cannot write from this client (HTTP 403
  `Resource not accessible by integration` on PR create, issue comment,
  issue close and label edits; reads work); agents use `gh` for every
  write: `gh pr create --repo dlwlzzero/nntrainer --base htp_moe`,
  `gh issue comment`, `gh issue close --reason completed`,
  `gh issue edit --add-label/--remove-label`.
* **Rungs 2–3 at the cycle-16 merge (2026-09-27):** PRs #121 / #125 /
  #126 / #127 / #128 were opened from the Mac with rungs 0–1 only; the user
  ran rungs 2–3 (skel + `build_android.sh --htp`) on the workstation at
  merge time, and **no skel/app md5s are recorded in those PRs**. The next
  handoff's rebuild recipe (rung 3, `hexagon-gates`) produces the md5s for
  `htp_moe` @ `758aaacc` or later; until then BENCHMARK's artifact table
  has no row for a post-#121 skel (the IDL grew by `mm_u8i4_conv_block`,
  the small-ops and `attn_m1_*` methods — a stale skel reads
  `0x8000040e`).
* **In-process HTP build (#84, cycle 17):** `meson setup build_htp_host
  -Denable-htp=true -Dhtp-inproc=true -Dhexagon-sdk-root=$HEXAGON_SDK_ROOT
  …` links the DSP skel subset (`test/htp/{hvx_add_f32,nntr_hvx_mm_u8i4,
  nntr_hvx_graph,nntr_hvx_small_ops,nntr_hvx_attn_m1}.c` + their `hmx/`,
  `hvx/` deps) into `libnntrainer.so` in place of the FastRPC stub, on
  scalar stand-ins (`test/htp/host/standin/hvx_scalar.c` for the HMX tile
  / GEMV / u8 quant / dequant / SwiGLU, `inproc/` for HexKL's micro API
  and the FastRPC runtime, `hvx_emu/` for the f32 intrinsics, `stub/qurt.h`
  for the pool) with `-Wl,--no-undefined` as the host twin of `build.sh`'s
  symbol guard. Gate: `bash test/htp/host/run_inproc_e2e.sh` → the five
  `E2E` lines and `INPROC E2E PASS` (tiny fixture, prompt 16 + 8, golden in
  `test/htp/host/golden/lfm2_moe_tiny/`). `NNTR_HTP_DUMP=<dir>` makes any
  run (host or phone) write every MoE call's input / output + a manifest;
  `tools/htp/htp_dump_eval.py <ref> <got>` compares two such directories.
  The profile's `dsp=` / transport columns on the host are the stand-ins'
  clock and mean nothing; never quote them. The real 8B model on the host
  needs an x86-packed twin (`nntr_quantize_stream … --moe_dtype QS4CX_WH`
  without `--isa ARM`) and is minutes per token on the scalar HMX
  stand-in: registration and dumps only, never a number.

* **#211 (2026-10-01): `NNTR_HTP_E2E_PDS` is a guard, not a switch.**
  Unset or `1` proceeds (one PD, the only E2E path); any other value
  throws at load naming #211, so a runner that still passes `_PDS=2`
  cannot label a one-PD row with a removed variant. Drop the guard with
  the next genuine IDL change, together with `role` in
  `token_driver_start` (the DSP accepts only 0) and the `hops` /
  `wait_us` / `hop_us` fields of `htp_dspq_token_resp` (they read 0):
  removing them now would have made a pure deletion the PR whose device
  failure mode is the stale-stub `transport failed: err=0xe`.

* **#211: `unittest_hvx_two_sessions` is the #178 platform probe, not the
  E2E path, and stays whole** (with `mailbox_run` and
  `nntr_hvx_mailbox.c`): it reserves its own S2 and never used
  `HtpBackend::openSecond` (deleted), its `S1Ceiling` is the runners'
  ceiling cell (`CEILING s1_mmap_mib=` before and after every run), and
  its Q1–Q5 lines are what rule 59 and ㉝ cite. Its `TwoSessions` name is
  a probe's.

* **#222 (2026-10-02): the engine keys act at prefill only, and the
  in-process host build runs them.** `conv_block_engine`, `dense_ffn_engine`
  and `attn_proj_engine` = `htp` (the config of record,
  `docs/measurements/config/q40-qs4cx-wh.nntr_config.json`, user decision
  on #222) move the M > 1 matmuls onto the HMX FC kernels; every decode
  row stays where it was (hybrid: the CPU kernels, every FC gate declines
  M == 1; one PD: `decode_row_resident`). Two code facts found on the
  way: (1) the `dense_ffn` one-layer form did not ask
  `htpDecodeRowResident`, so under `NNTR_HTP_E2E=1` it recomputed layers
  0–1's FFN on the CPU every token and threw it away (host: `cpu fc
  skipped` 8 / token instead of 10 on the lfm25 fixture; the logits are
  unchanged by the fix, bit-identical) — on the 8B the per-token skip
  count reads 32 with the keys (18 conv blocks, 6 × qkv + attention_out,
  2 dense_ffn) against 36 without; (2) `htp_qs4cx_from_q4_0x4` reads only
  the ARM q4_0x4 repack, so the in-process build (x86 repack) produced
  NaN logits with any key on: `qs4cxFromModelQ4_0` re-lays the host's
  repack as q4_0x4 off aarch64 (device bytes pass through unchanged).
  `causal_lm.cpp:715` registers the prefill's token only when the prompt
  is shorter than `init_seq_len`: at prompt 512 the old config (512)
  prints the text without its first token, the new one (1024) with it
  (`docs/measurements/prompts/README.md`).

* **#225 PR 1 (cycle 33, `7f95140ad`): the FC WH sidecar and the 512-row
  prefill chunks.** `nntr_quantize_stream --fc_wh_sidecar` writes the 66
  FC weights as `QS4CX_WH` images from f32 beside the main file
  (`<main>_fcwh.bin`; on the 8B 228,188,160 B, md5 `71812a91…`, main file
  md5 `7b7867fa…` unchanged); `fc_wh_file_name` in `nntr_config.json`
  names it. The loader preads each image into the arena keyed by the Q4_0
  bytes (not by name — see PR #230's deviations), no re-quantization, no
  heap copy; only an arena overflow unpacks bit-exactly to the heap
  (`[HTP] fc wh: arena=<n> heap=<n>`). The conv block / dense FFN / MoE
  prefill calls run in 512-row chunks, the conv history carried in `conv_w`
  [5 × C] (no IDL change) — host `CONV BLOCK CHUNKED BIT-IDENTICAL`; the
  user made the chunking the hybrid's way of record. The config of record
  does not name the sidecar until #225's handoff; a no-keys config leaves
  it unopened (bit-identical to before). E2E still binds Q4M1 until PR 2.

## 4. Reusable code on `hvx_impl` (survey 2026-09-21; read with `git show hvx_impl:<path>`)

`hvx_impl` (Qwen3-0.6B, W8A8 HVX-only) is frozen but its kernels and
harness are device-validated. What lifts, in value order:

| lift | from | serves | adaptation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DONE (#81, PR #126).** Lifted: the Kᵀ `[head_dim][max_seq]` layout (one f32 vector = 32 positions, not 64: f32 cache), the per-layer/per-kv-head cache indexing, the split by kv head with per-unit score scratch, the fp32 vector accumulation of PV, hvx/58's GQA fusion (one Kᵀ/V stream serves the 4 q heads of a kv head, as four accumulator sets in one pass). Not lifted: the fp16-widening scores (`hvx_vec_mpyacc_f32_f16`), the qf32 `hvx-exp.h`, the fp16 probabilities before PV, the scalar `1.0f / sum`, the hvx/58 position-block split + merge (re-associates the softmax), `HTP_ATTN_L2FETCH`, the token loop — all for the `_det` bit gate (plan 81 §3.3), the same reason #82 rejected `hvx-rmsnorm.c` / `hvx-rope.c`. Replaced by `nntrainer/tensor/attn_m1_det.h` + `hvx/hvx_attn_m1_f32.{c,h}`, plain Vsf with `hvx_exp_det_sf` / `hvx_recip_det_sf`. m=1 decode attention with a DSP-resident KV cache (K stored transposed `[head_dim][max_seq]` so one vector covers 64 positions; workers split by kv head) | `nntrainer/tensor/hexagon/htp/ops/hvx-attn.c` (152 LOC) | ⑨ attention | drop the token loop (m=1); per-worker score scratch from the orchestrator; KV dtype vs `hexkl_kv_quant.c` (fp16 there, u8 here → dequant in the score loop if u8 stays); `wp_run` → `hvx_worker_pool_run` |
| "DSP owns the graph": validate the op list once at init, then `forward(tokens, pos → logits)` runs `for op in ops: table[kind]()` with per-op pcycles and one FARF line per call | `htp/htp_graph.{h,c}` (~200 of 546 LOC), `htp/nntr_htp.idl` (3 methods incl. `forward_debug`), `htp/executor.c` (fd mmap + `AEE_EALREADY` handling) | ⑨ one call per token | add a `forward` entry beside the per-op IDL; rebuild `next_mm[]` over the LFM2.5 op sequence; repopulate the op table with MoE/conv1d/dense kinds |
| cross-op weight prefetch: two op-independent VTCM half-slabs so the last chunk of op N kicks chunk 0 of op N+1 while norm/RoPE/attention run in between | `htp/ops/hvx-matmul.c` `mm_slab`/`mm_worker_vtcm`/`mm_pf_kick` (~120 LOC) | ⑥ ⑨ | hvx_impl's per-worker push/pop DMA FIFO vs our global index ring (`hexkl_dma_ring_push2d` + `next_idx`/`wait`): rewrite the pipeline loop; keep the "drain, never abandon" rule for a prefetch left by another op |
| **DONE (#84, PR #127 `ec589373`).** Lifted: the `E2E step/gen` line format and the `--eval` verdict (`bit_identical` + SNR, as `tools/htp/htp_dump_eval.py` over per-call `NNTR_HTP_DUMP` dumps, the first differing file named). Not lifted: `HexagonRunner` / `RpcmemBuffer` (here `HtpBackend` / `HtpRpcMemApi` are the code under test), `run_e2e_test.sh` (agents never run adb; the md5 gate is `md5sum -c` in the handoff recipe), `summ_farf_prof.py` (the ARM prints `[HTP-PROFILE]` as a table), `find_divergence.py` (every call is dumped in order, the first non-identical file is the divergence), `make_tokens.py`, the static-map probe (`htp_moe` maps arenas with `FASTRPC_MAP_FD_DELAYED`). Replaced by the in-process build (`-Dhtp-inproc=true`, `build_htp_host`): the ARM owns the graph on `htp_moe`, so the driver is nntrainer's own decode loop (`test/htp/host/htp_e2e_test.cpp`, `run_inproc_e2e.sh`). host E2E harness without the CausalLM app: `hexagon_e2e_test` (`--tokens/--chunk/--steps/--eval/--dump-*`, `E2E` lines), `HexagonRunner`, `RpcmemBuffer`, md5-gated `run_e2e_test.sh`, `summ_farf_prof.py`, `find_divergence.py` (needs `forward_debug`), `make_tokens.py` | `test/hexagon/hexagon_e2e_test.cpp`, `nntrainer/tensor/hexagon/host/*`, `tools/hexagon/*` (~650 LOC) | measurement | replace the qwen3 lowering/config with LFM2.5's; `NNTR_HAVE_FASTRPC_MAP_STATIC` probe into `test/htp/build.sh` |
| **DONE (#82, PR #125).** Lifted: the per-head chunking (`chunk = head_dim`), the rotate-half structure with one vector per half, the cos/sin row formula as the host check's input generator. Not lifted: the fp16/qf32 arithmetic and `Vhf_equals_Wqf32` (v75/v79 differ), the scalar `1.0f / sqrtf` per row (libm bits no host spec can pin), `hvx-quant.h` (these ops end before the quantizer). Replaced by `nntrainer/tensor/m1_ops_det.h` + `hvx/hvx_m1_ops_f32.c`, plain Vsf with a `_det` bit gate. small ops: RMSNorm (also per-head q/k norm via `FLAG_PER_HEAD`), RoPE (`rope_rotate`, 20 lines, head_dim 128 hard-coded — LFM2.5 is 64), the shared fp32 cos/sin row `nntr_htp_rope.h`, and the quantizer's integer-only rounding recipe (one qf32 product, then sign/exp/significand split, ties-to-even) that made results v75/v79-portable | `htp/ops/hvx-rmsnorm.c`, `hvx-rope.c`, `nntr_htp_rope.h`, `hvx/hvx-quant.h` (~295 LOC) | ⑨ | activation dtype (fp16 there, f32 residual here); our quantizer is asymmetric u8 with zero point — port the rounding only if `hvx_quant_u8.c` still reads sf bits after a qf32 op |

Not lifted: the W8A8 tiled `vrmpy` matmul (wrong layout for int4; our `hvx_gemm_u8i4_wh_col` is the math), `dma-queue.c` (we have `hexkl_dma_ring.c`), the worker pool (ours is richer; note the opposite HVX-context convention: hvx_impl locks a unit per worker and leaves none for the caller, ours runs index 0 inline), the qwen3 lowering/packer/app glue, the simulator harness (no simulator here). Causal depthwise conv1d (L=3) + gating has no counterpart on either branch: net-new.

Silicon rules from `hvx_impl`'s HEXAGON.md §7 that bind here too: compute in fp32 inside an op and narrow to fp16 once (`Vhf_equals_Vqf16` after a qf16 multiply rounds badly, 2.7 % PPL); clamp the SiLU exp argument (already 85 here, doc 44); `-mhvx-ieee-fp` is required for fp16 intrinsics on toolchain 19; int32 `vrmpy` sums are exact in any order, divergence enters only in the epilogue; qf32→sf conversion differs between v75 and v79, so quantizers decode integers, never sf bits; HVX code runs only on threads that own an HVX context; validate `k` bounds for exact int accumulation; never compare wall-clock tok/s across units, report pcycles and `pcycles_per_us`.
