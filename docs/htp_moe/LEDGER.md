# HTP MoE decode ledger — rules learned on silicon, verdicts, open items

Contract: `docs/plans/0001-htp-moe-decode-agent-system.md`. The supervisor
appends here; the planner and implementer read it before touching a kernel.

## Upstream

PR nntrainer/nntrainer#4327, branch `claude/htp-lfm2-moe-ffn` on
`Seunghui98/nntrainer`. `htp_moe` is frozen at head **`2ce38d65`**
(2026-09-21 06:45 UTC, "[CausalLM] Route conv out_proj and the dense FFN to
the HTP by config"). New commits since: none seen.

## 1. Rules (device disagreed with reasoning; do not re-derive)

Inherited from the PR's device work, with their sources:

1. **A `--profile` build is never the tok/s binary** — it inflates prefill
   by 83 % (doc 46 §43.4).
2. **Read `min`, not `avg`** — profile averages include the first
   (registration) call (doc 46 §48.7).
3. **Rebuild the skel whenever the IDL or DSP sources change**;
   `build_android.sh` never does. Symptom of a stale skel:
   `AEE_EBADPARM (0x8000040E)` (doc 46 §48.7).
4. **`build_android.sh --clean` drops `-Denable-htp` silently**; check
   `readelf -d libnntrainer.so` for `libsdkl.so` (mobile guide §4).
5. **Never push the link-time stub `libcdsprpc.so`** to the phone (mobile
   guide §5).
6. **`QS4CX_WH` has no CPU fallback**; a wrong layout gives plausible wrong
   text, not an error; `moe_htp_layers` must be empty (doc 46 §35, §48.7).
7. **Moving a matmul to the HTP does not pay when the round trip exceeds
   the matmul** — conv in_proj: −13 ms of an expected −65..−100 (doc 50
   §3.4); the same rule closed doc 45 §0.
8. **The DSP address space, not host RAM, bounds registration**: 3840 MiB
   arena + ≈ 182 MiB heap in one 4 GiB space; 256 MiB chunks avoid the
   alignment waste that made it look like a 3 GiB limit (doc 46 §39–§41).
9. **Decode drifts between sittings without a code cause** (20.8 → 16.5,
   doc 50 §3.4; ±5 % in `hvx_impl` #53): every sitting starts with the
   control binary, and results are read as A/B inside the sitting.
10. **Cross-session decode numbers from another unit are provisional**
    (two S25 Ultra units: 6–8.6 % apart on one binary, `hvx_impl` #23/#53).

## 2. Verdicts (measured, closed)

| item | verdict | source |
|---|---|---|
| Tier-1 per-expert FastRPC (176 calls/token) | regression by construction (57 ms transport) | doc 41 §3 |
| Grouped gate_up at decode | built; transport 326 → 68 µs/mm | doc 34 §4E |
| In-place tile dequant, weight residency, cross-matmul prefetch, HVX worker pool, poll QoS + ION | built and verified | doc 34 §4A–F |
| GEMV instead of HMX at M=1 (prefill FC context) | rejected there (padding tax ~40 µs) — **re-opened for decode** where the 64-row tile is wall 1 (1.03 of 1.35 ms) | doc 34 §5.1 vs doc 48 §3 |
| Phase A W1/Q1/DQ1 micro-optimisations | one of four survived (D1: overlap weight DMA with activation quant) | doc 44 Phase A |
| Fused SwiGLU MoE path (A1) | passed, 32/32 `max_abs_err=0` | doc 44 |
| conv in_proj on HTP | runs, text identical, −13 ms prefill, not a decode lever | doc 50 §3.4 |
| Whole-model residency (doc 45) | plan exists, prefill-ordered; we take its Phase E (one call per token) first, M=1 shape | contract §3.1 |

## 3. Open items (candidates for issues; the supervisor promotes them)

| # | item | expected | depends on |
|---|---|---|---|
| ① | Measurement A: `--profile` decode breakdown of the ARM remainder (FC, mha, lm_head, other) | tells whether FC thread over-splitting (doc 46 §45) is first | first handoff |
| ② | Measurement B: `NNTR_HTP_PROFILE=3` transport floor — wake/clock (→ resident worker / dspqueue) vs marshalling (→ prebound handles + buffer cleanup) | picks the transport fix | first handoff |
| ③ | Measurement C: arena DMA probe — linear vs 2D descriptors, 1–4 engines each `dmstart`, bus vote on/off | explains 18 vs 38 GB/s | first handoff |
| ④ | Two-reader DDR probe: CPU and DSP streaming disjoint buffers concurrently, aggregate GB/s | decides whether the CPU+NPU split (contract §3.2) can ever pay | first handoff |
| ⑤ | HVX GEMV for M ≤ 6 reading WH tiles in VTCM (wall 1) | MoE DSP 1.35 → ≈ 0.3 ms/call if DMA ≥ 30 GB/s | ③ |
| ⑥ | DMA path fix (wall 2) | 1.19 → 0.57 ms floor per call | ③ |
| ⑦ | Transport (wall 3): dspqueue or resident worker | 0.57 → ≤ 0.1 ms per call | ② |
| ⑧ | lm_head blocked Q4_0 twin on device (doc 46 §46): confirm 25.7 → ≈ 3.4 ms | ARM remainder | ① |
| ⑨ | One FastRPC call per token: M=1 RMSNorm, conv1d + gating, RoPE, attention, dense FFN, lm_head on the DSP; per-token entry in the IDL | removes 22 round trips and the ARM remainder | ⑤ ⑥ ⑦ |
| ⑩ | Registration at load time, bake cache on disk (doc 45 Phase D "P4") | load time, not speed | — |
| ⑪ | Prefill residency (doc 45 B/C/D) | prefill 523 → 700+ | after decode goal |
| ⑫ | CPU+NPU expert split | raises the ceiling only if ④ > 45 GB/s | ④, user decision Q11 |
| ⑬ | (withdrawn 2026-09-21: no simulator in this project, user decision) | — | — |
