# Measurement 132 PR 2: the CPU-exact FC, router, SwiGLU and argmax on silicon

Branch `htp/132-exact-fc`, PR code @ `cd611465`; the device set is built
from `dev/fc-shadow` @ `fec9d999` (= the PR diff plus one inert measurement
commit, never merged). Plan `docs/plans/132-cpu-exact-fc-lmhead.md` Part A,
step A6. Estimated device time: **≈ 55 min** (state + install 4, G0 6, G1 3,
G3 2, G4 + G2 4, speed 14, router profile 2, nll + text 16, checks 2, plus
cool-down waits). Run by the orchestrator:

```
bash /local/mnt/workspace/htp_moe/132/run_132.sh R3CY10WM83Y
```

(a byte-identical copy is `docs/measurements/132-pr2-run.sh` on this
branch). The script logs to `/local/mnt/workspace/htp_moe/132/logs/`,
writes the summary to `logs/sitting.out`, stops only on a missing unit, a
set / device md5 mismatch or `0x8000040e` (stale skel), counts every other
missing expected line (`expectation mismatches: N`) and **reports** the
plan's stop rules (`plan stop rules hit: N`) instead of stopping, so that
G3 and G4 — decision D's inputs — are read in the same sitting whatever G0
and G1 show.

## Why

1. Every op the decode may move to the NPU must produce the Android CPU's
   bits (LEDGER rule 45). PR 2 writes the CPU's order down as specs
   (`q4_gemv_cpu_det.h`, `m1_ops_det.h`) and makes the DSP equal them. The
   host proves spec == an independent model of the CPU and kernel ==
   spec on the emulation and the ISS; this sitting reads the three things
   the host cannot: the spec against **this set's** CPU functions (G0),
   the kernel on silicon (G1), and every op on the model's real
   activations, DSP against CPU (G2).
2. Decision D (plan §3.4) needs two numbers: the exact FC's rate on
   silicon (G3; the CPU does FC + lm_head in 7.4 ms/token) and the DSP
   address space left to the loaded app (G4).

### Variants (one set, switched by env)

| | env (beyond `NNTR_NUM_THREADS=8`) | expected |
|---|---|---|
| **A** (reference, first) | none | `[HTP] dspq: on` once, `dspq: close calls=N served=N bad=0`, no `graph:` line |
| **S** | `NNTR_FC_SHADOW=<file>` | as A; plus `fc.bin` records. The DSP re-runs every M=1 FC / lm_head slice, residual ADD and router on the CPU's own input for the first 8 decode steps (`NNTR_FC_SHADOW_STEPS`, default 8; 0 in the G2 cell) and writes both outputs. **Nothing the CPU computes is replaced**, so S's text and nll must equal A's. Under the shadow the residual adds are built as `residual_add` (`copy(in0)`, `add_i(in1)`: the `addition` layer's bits) to carry the ADD records |
| **P / Pb** (profile only) | `NNTR_HTP_FORWARD=1 …KINDS=MOE,RMSNORM,QK_NORM,ROPE,CONV1D_GATE,ATTN_M1,ADD,ROUTER_TOPK NNTR_HTP_PROFILE=2`; Pb with `ADSP_LIBRARY_PATH=<D>/base` (the `htp_moe` skel, the old HVX router) | `graph: init … resident=RMSNORM\|CONV1D_GATE\|QK_NORM\|ROPE\|ATTN_M1\|ADD\|ROUTER_TOPK\|MOE`, `calls/token=51.00`; the `ROUTER_TOPK=` pcycles/op of the new scalar-chain router against the old one (the code review's finding 3). Never a tok/s cell; the text is not compared |

`fec9d999`'s ARM tree equals `a031b42e`'s, from which the app binaries
were built (the two differ by a comment in `test/htp/nntr_hvx_fc_q4.c`);
the skel was rebuilt at `fec9d999`. Not staged, never pushed:
`libcdsprpc.so` (rule 5).

Workstation checks done while staging:

* G0's premise: `llvm-objdump` of the set's `libnntrainer.so` /
  `libcausallm_core.so` against the 2026-09-29 `norm/set` the plan read
  (§0): `nntr_gemv_q4_0_4x8_q8_0` (one `fmla` chain), `nntr_quantize_row_q8_0`
  (the two `fdiv`), `neon::swiglu`, `cblas_sgemv` and
  `buildExpertAssignments` disassemble identically (0 differing lines,
  address operands normalized).
* Rung 1: `run_host_checks.sh` (`ALL CHECKS PASS` ×3, `WORKER POOL LANES OK`,
  `Q4 GEMV CPU-ORDER OK mutants=6/6`, `Q4 GEMV BIT-IDENTICAL`, `ROUTER TOPK
  BIT-IDENTICAL`, `M1 OPS BIT-IDENTICAL`), `htp_syntax_check.sh` 0,
  `*Lfm2Moe*` 6 passed, `INPROC E2E PASS` (fixture lines with
  ROUTER_TOPK resident: `d-tiny` 146.32 dB, `d-hd64` 52.92, `d-lfm25`
  133.63, tokens 8/8 each). Rung 2 as above. Rung 3 on the PR head and on
  the dev head: the NEEDED / strings checks and both gtest binaries.
* The dev commit on the host (in-process, hd64 fixture, 8 steps): tokens
  equal to switch-off 8/8, ADD records 14/14 equal; router records 0/14
  and no FC records **by design** (the x86 CPU's sgemv is not the aarch64
  order; the FC hook lives in the ARM backend). The plan's host A4 gate
  "every record equal" cannot hold on x86; G2 is a device reading.
* ISS (`hexagon-sim -mv79 --timing`, one thread, K = 2048, N = 256), every
  variant bit-equal to the spec on 4 rows: pcycles per (column, 32-block)
  step **3.75** HVX native (120 per 32-column vector-step; the planner's
  prototype 124), **4.07** intrinsics, **5.01 / 4.76 / 5.79** sffma with
  8 / 16 / 32 columns in flight. Not a gate (contract §12); G3 reads the
  real ones.

## Steps (the script does all of it)

0. `adb devices`, the unit, `input keyevent 223`, battery / zone0, wait
   until zone0 ≤ 35 °C (also before G1, G3, each G, each prompt).
1. md5 of the workstation set, push to `<C>/s132`, the base skel to
   `s132/base/`, md5 on the device against `md5.txt`, config
   (`do_sample false`, `bad_word_ids [124900]`, `moe_engine htp`).
2. **G0** `unittest_nntrainer_cpu_backend --gtest_filter='Q8QuantCpuOrder.*:Q4GemvCpuOrder.*:SwigluCpuOrder.*:SgemvNCpuOrder.*:ExpfBionic.*'`. Expected:
   `Q8QuantCpuOrder rows=4000 bad_blocks=0`,
   `Q4GemvCpuOrder K=… N=… rows=2000 bad=0 layout=ok` ×5,
   `SwigluCpuOrder n=7168 rows=2000 bad=0`,
   `SgemvNCpuOrder K=2048 E=32 rows=2000 bad_logits=0 bad_sel=0`,
   `ExpfBionic inputs=4278190082 bad=0`, `PASSED ] 5 tests`.
   ExpfBionic prints the first 16 differing inputs; the host's glibc
   corrects two inputs the algorithm misrounds (`0x4202422f`,
   `0xc27c65d9`), so if bionic does too they are the ones listed.
3. **G1** `unittest_hvx_softmax --gtest_filter='HvxFcQ4.MatchesSpecBitExact:HvxFcQ4.SmallOpsMatchSpec:HvxM1Ops.*'`. Expected:
   `FC_Q4_FIELD K=… N=… variant=… feed=… rows=8 bad=0` ×50 (5 shapes ×
   {hvx_native, hvx_intrin, sffma8, sffma16, sffma32} × {direct, vtcm}),
   `FC_Q4_FIELD total bad=0`,
   `FC_Q4_FIELD small ops: q8_quant bad_rows=0 swiglu_cpu bad=0 argmax bad=0`,
   `M1_OPS_FIELD router_topk … bad_logits=0 bad_sel=0 bad_weight=0` ×3,
   and #164's `HvxM1Ops` lines as before.
4. **G3** `--gtest_filter='HvxFcQ4.Rate'` with zone0 before / after:
   `FC_RATE K N variant feed lanes us_per_call quant_us pcyc_per_call
   cyc_per_colstep_lane GBps bad` per cell (6 shapes × 5 variants × 2 feeds
   × 1 / 2 / 4 / 6 lanes), `FC_RATE_PROJ … ms_per_token=… (fc=… lm_head=…)
   quant_ms=… cpu_reference_ms=7.4` per variant, feed and lane count,
   `FC_RATE bad_total=0`. The lm_head is one 16384-row slice × 7.8125.
5. **G4** A, prompt 512, G = 8, `NNTR_HEAP_PROBE=1 NNTR_PPL_DECODE=cont.ids`
   (self; writes A's continuation): `[HTP] arena …` lines and
   `[HTP] heap probe: <N> MiB allocatable in 1 MiB chunks`.
6. **G2** S, same prompt, G = 8, forced on `cont.ids`,
   `NNTR_FC_SHADOW_STEPS=0`; pull `fc.bin`; `fc_shadow_check.py`:
   `FC SHADOW … fc=n/n add=n/n router=n/n` (every record bit-equal, each
   n > 0), per step ≈ 74 FC records (18 × 2 conv + 6 × 4 attention + 2 × 3
   dense FFN + 8 lm_head slices), 48 ADD, 22 router; nll of S == A.
7. Speed and inertness, prompt 512, **A S S A** at G = 64 / 512 / 1024:
   S's text == A's (run 1 of the same G), prefill of S ≥ −5 % of A.
8. Router profile: Pb then P at G = 64 (see Variants).
9. Eight prompts at G = 256: A self (`cont_p0i.ids`), S forced on it (nll
   lines equal to 17 digits), then A and S unforced (text identical).

Reference: the NPU "now" is 51.82 / 50.61 / 47.36 decode tok/s (#158 B,
`R3CY10WM83Y`, 2026-09-29); A of this sitting is the reference for every
cell. S's decode speed is not read (the shadow works during its first 8
steps); its prefill is (the shadow does not run at M > 1).

## Notes from the run

<serial, battery, zone0 log, FARF/AEE errors, anything stale>

## What the verdicts mean (plan §4 A7)

* G0 ✓ G1 ✓ G2 ✓: Part A closes. The ROUTER_TOPK kind becomes CPU-exact
  (with #164's norms, the next per-token-entry sitting can read text ≡ A
  for masks that include it). The G3 and G4 tables go to the user as
  decision D.
* G1 ✗ on `hvx_native` only: the IEEE `.sf` instructions are not RN on
  silicon; the intrinsics variant is the fallback (plan §5).
* G0 ✗: the CPU is not what §0 read; the printed differences name the
  function. ExpfBionic ✗ on exactly the two glibc-corrected inputs: the
  port needs those two as exceptions (a two-entry table).

Reported by the orchestrator; the numbers below are copied from the logs.

| G4 | heap probe 113 MiB (1 MiB chunks) |
| S vs A | tokens, nll and logits equal; 8 prompts nll and text equal |
| resident ROUTER_TOPK | 427 784 pcycles/op (CPU-order scalar chains) vs 34 100 (the old HVX router) |

The runner's 8-prompt loop wrote its logs as `*_p03` / `*_p04`: `cool()`
reused the loop's `i`. Fixed (`local t z`) in both runners.

## Sitting S3 (after sitting 1)

Branch `htp/132-exact-fc`; set `/local/mnt/workspace/htp_moe/132/set2/`
from `dev/fc-shadow`; runner
`bash /local/mnt/workspace/htp_moe/132/run_132s3.sh R3CY10WM83Y`
(≈ 35 min; copy `docs/measurements/132-pr2-run-s3.sh`); logs
`/local/mnt/workspace/htp_moe/132/logs_s3/`. What changed since sitting 1:

1. **One kernel.** `hvx_q4_gemv_f32.c` is the intrinsics kernel only;
   `hvx_native` and the sffma tail are gone from the entry (`fc_q4m1_f32`'s
   variant word is the feed bit alone), so the shadow's call is the
   intrinsics kernel: G2 must read **fc 600/600**.
2. **Why native / sffma read 0.** Both used the inline-asm IEEE
   `vadd / vsub / vmpy (.sf = .sf op .sf)` instructions (the sffma tail
   for its `d_w * d_a` terms); `hvx_intrin` uses only the `Q6_Vsf_*`
   intrinsics, which the compiler lowers to a `qf32` op and a conversion
   even with `-mhvx-ieee-fp`. #164's norm and the router passed because
   they use the scalar `sffma` and the intrinsics, never the asm form. So
   the difference is not the rounding of any op: it is that instruction
   form, which the v79 ISS executes and the phone returns 0 for.
   `HvxFcQ4.SfProbe` confirms it on silicon: each op on 256 random normal
   pairs and on the operands of the kernel's first failing step (group 0,
   block 0: P1 = F1 * S1, P2 = F2 * S2, uh = P1 + P2), asm form vs
   intrinsics vs scalar sffma, against the host's IEEE result.
3. **Vector quantizer** (`hvx_q4m1_prep`): amax by a word max of the
   sign-cleared bits, d and 1/d by the scalar divide (`sfrecipa` /
   `sffixup`, IEEE RN: `HvxFcQ4.ScalarDivide` sweeps every mantissa of
   both divides on silicon, the ISS sweep is below), q by the 1.5 * 2^23
   magic add (ties to even), bytes by `vpacke`, sums by a rotate-add
   tree; blocks under 2^-100 run the scalar spec. Host:
   `Q8 QUANT HVX rows=3000 bad_rows=0`. ISS, K = 2048: **10 738** pcycles
   per call against the scalar spec's 105 609 (G3 reads the silicon
   `quant_ms`; target < 0.5 ms/token).
4. **Router**: 8 register-resident sffma chains per pool lane (4 lanes at
   E = 32), each lane also computing its experts' sigmoids; the pick is
   serial. ISS, one lane: 41 k pcycles per 8-chain group plus ≈ 4 k of
   sigmoids per lane; ≈ 50 k projected at 4 lanes (target ≤ 60 k). The
   graph's ROUTER_TOPK passes `env->pool`, the test entry the session's.
