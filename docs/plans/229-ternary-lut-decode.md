# 229 — Gemma 4 ternary experts: what a LUT dequantization gains at decode, against ternary → 4-bit + the existing HVX kernels

Issue: dlwlzzero/nntrainer#229 (p1, review first, no kernel). Base
`htp_decode` @ `8d164e534`. Contract `docs/plans/0001`; plan 201 §3.2 /
§3.4 own the Gemma byte and pool arithmetic this plan re-runs; LEDGER
rules 43 / 44 / 59 the rates. Reference survey:
`docs/htp_moe/t-man-lut-reference.md` (T-MAN fork @ `817bd29`, read
read-only in a scratch clone for this plan). **Added 2026-10-06 (user):
upstream PR nntrainer/nntrainer#4410 "[htp] lfm2 moe ffn 2bit gemv"
(Jungwon-Lee, head `0d603f29a`, fetched as `refs/pr/4410`, open, not
merged, merge-base `9deea6e2e` = 491 commits behind `htp_decode`)** — it
already holds options B and C as code, measured on an S25; its doc 54
(`docs/htp_attention/54_w2a8_experts_task.md` on that branch) is the
measured history quoted below.

Evidence tags: **[M]** measured on silicon (doc / rule cited; `[M-LFM]`
= on LFM2.5-8B-A1B, `[M-4410]` = doc 54's S25 unit `R3CY205ZMND`),
**[C]** code read at `path:line`, **[G]** arithmetic from the Gemma config
(plan 201 §2.4) or from [M] inputs, **[E]** estimate / guess, marked where
it enters.

**Headline.** The T-MAN kernel does not need porting. PR #4410's
`QS2CX_WH` (2-bit codes in whPack nibble order + a 4-entry int4 palette
per tensor + per-column scale / colsum) holds ternary {−1, 0, +1} × a
per-column scale **exactly** (one palette entry unused), and its native
GEMV `hvx_gemm_u8i2_wh_col*` feeds `vrmpyacc` from a register LUT with no
int4 materialised in VTCM and the **same int32 accumulator** as the 4-bit
path — bit-identical by construction, +25.9 % decode on LFM where only the
`mm` (DMA) column moved [M-4410 §5.18]. For Gemma 26B-A4B the experts at
2 bits take the byte floor from 34 to 45 tok/s; the 50 bar needs the
attention and dense FCs at 2 bits as well (floor 61), which is only
reachable once those FCs run on WH tiles (#225). What stays open is the
checkpoint's scale layout: a per-group / per-block ternary scale cannot be
held exactly by any per-column format here (needs-user).

## 1. Goal and gate

Acceptance (issue): a plan with numbers that decides whether S6 adds B or
C — per-token bytes and time for A / B / C per op kind on the 26B-A4B
shape against the 50 tok/s bar, the VTCM budget, the pool slot count, the
accuracy gate per option, and the lightest measurement that settles the
one number the host cannot give. Measurable form:

| gate | where | pass |
|---|---|---|
| bytes / time table | §3.2 of this plan | every number tagged [M] / [G] / [E]; the floor per option in tok/s against 50 |
| the format is exact for ternary | host: `whPack2 → expand == whPack` (`expand_i2i4_host_check`), the Gemma writer's palette {−1, 0, +1} | bytes identical to a `QS4CX_WH` write of the same ternary tensor; `moe_layer_host_check` 2-bit cell `bitwise mismatches=0`; `run_inproc_e2e.sh` Gemma lines `bit_identical=1` against the 4-bit run |
| speed (S4, device) | BENCHMARK Gemma block, `decode tok/s, NPU, gen 64 / 512 / 1024`, prompt 512, cool start, same sitting as A | B ≥ A + the §3.2 prediction's lower bound (experts only: ≈ +5 tok/s); the `mm` column is the only stage that moves (the §5.18 signature) |
| standing | prefill ≥ −5 % of the sitting's A (prefill is M > 1 and never takes the GEMV: unchanged by construction, read anyway); text identical to the CPU run for A / B (bit-identical options); `QS4CX_WH` / `QS2CX_WH` have no CPU fallback (`FloatTensor::dot` throws, doc 54 §5.4) | — |

For option C-TMAN (the T-MAN LUT GEMV proper, not #4410's register-LUT)
the text gate is D2's: decode PPL ≤ 1.02 × A pooled, no new loop, user
approval — it is not bit-identical (§3.5).

## 2. Where it lives

Nothing changes in this issue. What S6 (or the issue this plan spawns)
would touch, with the contract consumers:

| piece | `htp_decode` today [C] | #4410 brings [C, `git show refs/pr/4410:…`] |
|---|---|---|
| expert file format | `QS4CX_WH`: `whPack` nibble permutation, `nntrainer/tensor/htp_wh_layout.h:60-90`; writer `Applications/CausalLM/quantize_stream.cpp:376-397` (dtype tag), Gemma gate \| up writer from #231 | `QS2CX_WH` `[K·N/4 codes][4 palette][N f32 scale][N f32 colsum]`, `whPack2` in `qs4cx_tensor.h`, palette DP `htp_wh_palette.h`, `--moe_dtype QS2CX_WH` (commits `1a6928769`, `fe643e45c`) — **the quantizer's format tag and the loader check move** |
| M=1 GEMV | `hvx/hvx_gemm_u8i4_wh.c:65-84` `gemm_row1`: per 128 B of nibbles 1 load, `vasl`, 2 `vand`, 2 `vrmpyacc`; accumulator order documented in `hvx_gemm_u8i4_wh.h:52-60` | `hvx_gemm_u8i2_wh_col{,_nopf}`, `_cols2_nopf` (two columns share the activation splats), `_prefetch` for 256-byte tiles; per 128 B of codes 1 load, `vlsr`, 2 `vand`, 2 `vlut32`, 2 `vasl`, 4 `vand`, 4 `vrmpyacc` — the two `vlut32` results are exactly the two vectors the i4 loop loaded, so the int32 sum is the same (commit `dfca0acbf`) |
| expand (option B proper) | — | `hvx/hvx_expand_i2i4.{c,h}`: 2 `vlut32` + (no `vshuff` after `c2cdfab0a`) per 256 B out, table in a register; IDL entry `expand_i2i4` + device gtest `HvxExpandI2I4.MatchesScalarBitExact` (`08f44155d`, `5aa3b4357`) — **IDL `test/htp/nntr_hvx.idl` + `generate_stub.sh` + skel move** |
| MoE kernel routing | `hmx/hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c:538-623` M=1 feed: two gate_up slabs, 4 DMA queues (#177), schedule table | `moe_all_2bit` / `native_i2`: half-size slabs (`feed_gu_bytes = gu_bytes / 2`), `moe_m1_push(…, all_2bit)`, per-expert `g_lut` / `d_lut`, `HEXKL_PROBE_EXPAND` stage — **`NNTR_HTP_PROFILE` stage tables and `tools/htp_fc_report.py` gain the `expand` column** |
| weight registry | `hexkl_weight_u8i4_table` slots; `HtpComputeOps` `takeExpertSlot` (`htp_compute_ops.cpp:4920-4962`), pool miss `readWeight` `:5172`, swap offsets `:4964-4970` | `slots[h].bits` (2 or 4), `wh_bytes` halves — **`HtpComputeOps` slot size, arena budget and the miss read move with `bits`** |
| host checks | `test/htp/host/{moe_layer_host_check.c,gemv_native_check.c}`, `run_host_checks.sh` | `expand_i2i4_host_check.cc`, the 2-bit M1 GEMV cell (`dma_kb=10752 vs 21504 (want half)`), `standin/hvx_scalar.c` `vlut32` twin |
| FC / lm_head kinds | `test/htp/nntr_hvx_fc_q4.c` on `Q4M1` (Q4_0 blocks, `q4_gemv_cpu_det.h:330-335`), VTCM-fed; #225 (on `htp_first_version`, not here) moves the FC set to `QS4CX_WH` tiles and `hexkl_mm_u8i4_fc_m1_run` | nothing: #4410 has no 2-bit FC, attention or lm_head path |

What #4410 lacks that `htp_decode` has (merge-base `9deea6e2e`): the one-PD
token driver (#211), the FSU pool inside the token (#201 S1/S2), the
4-queue feed (#177 / #185), the Gemma S4 kernels (GeGLU epilogue
`HEXKL_MOE_FLAG_GEGLU`, `hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.h:377`), the hd64 fixtures.
Its "resident MoE decode stream" (`0d603f29a`) parallels our token driver
and is not taken.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 The three options, restated on what exists

| | where the ternary → int4 step runs | DDR bytes, experts | kernel | bits |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | converter / load: 4-bit `QS4CX_WH` in the file and the arena | 4 bits/w | today's `gemm_row1` | bit-identical to the CPU run (3 levels fit int4 exactly) |
| **B** | DSP, per expert into VTCM: `QS2CX_WH` in DDR, `hvx_expand_i2i4` after the slab lands, then `gemm_row1` on the int4 slab | 2 bits/w | #4410 `be916a261` | bit-identical; ≈ 86 µs/call of expansion still exposed on LFM with two slabs [M-4410 §5.18.5] |
| **C-reg** | none: `QS2CX_WH` read packed, the 128-byte code-pair table in one HVX register, `vlut32` → `vrmpyacc` | 2 bits/w | #4410 `dfca0acbf` (`hvx_gemm_u8i2_wh_*`), host-exact, **not yet measured on a device** | bit-identical (same int32 sums) |
| **C-TMAN** | none: T-MAN `hvx_lut_ctor` (activation → int16 LUT of ±x sums per g = 4) + `hvx_tbl` BitNet path (`vlut16` per bit-plane, int16 → int32 → qf32) + `hvx_bit_serial` | 2 bits/w (2 bit-planes) | port of `hvx_funcs.h` ≈ l.538–700, weights laid out by a port of `hvx_preprocess_weights` | **not** bit-identical: activation quantized to int16 per tensor, qf32 epilogue |

**Chosen: C-reg (#4410's native u8i2 GEMV) ported onto the one-PD pool
path, with B's expand kernel kept only as the host spec and the device
gate for `vlut32`.** Reasons, each from a measurement: (1) the M=1 GEMV is
DDR-bound, not issue-bound — 344 k `vrmpy` ≈ 25 µs of pool time per LFM
call against 676 µs of `mm` [M-4410 §5.18.1], and the 4-bit feed's
engine is busy 640–682 of 712 µs [M-LFM, BENCHMARK cycle 15] — so a LUT
that saves instructions buys nothing, and the only thing 2 bits can buy
is the halved DMA column; C-reg takes all of it, B leaves ≈ 86 µs/call
exposed unless the slab count doubles (§3.4). (2) C-reg's int32 sums are
the 4-bit path's, so every gate stays bit-identity (rule 45's deciding
failure is repetition after a non-identical kernel; D2 allows a loss, the
plan does not spend it here). (3) The code exists with host proofs
(`gemv_native_check`, `moe_layer_host_check`); the port cost is the merge
into the pool path, not a kernel.

**Rejected: C-TMAN.** Its gain over `vrmpy` is instruction count (per
1024 weights ≈ 14 vector ops with four `vlut16` on the permute unit vs
C-reg's ≈ 32), which matters only where compute is the wall — plan 194
L10's reading, now re-confirmed at 2 bits by the 25 µs / 676 µs ratio
above [G from M-4410]. It costs a second activation format (int16 LUT,
per-tensor scale: `static_assert(ActGroupSize == -1)` in the BitNet
`hvx_tbl`), a qf32 epilogue, a second weight layout (bit-planes,
`vlut16` even / odd interleave), has no unit tests upstream, and breaks
bit-identity. It is kept as the fallback only if S3's ISS reading shows
C-reg compute-bound at the Gemma shapes (§4), which the numbers say it is
not.

### 3.2 Bytes a token and the floor, 26B-A4B, per option and per kind

Shape [G, plan 201 §2.4]: hidden 2816, 30 layers, 128 experts top-8,
`moe_intermediate` 704, dense `intermediate` 2112, 25 sliding layers (q/k/v/o
34.6 M weights) + 5 global (49.0 M, K = V), vocab 262 144 tied. Expert =
gate \| up [2816 × 1408] + down [704 × 2816] = 5.95 M weights.

Weights read per token [G]: experts 8 × 30 × 5.95 M = **1.427 B**;
attention **1.11 B**; dense FFN 30 × 17.8 M = **535 M**; lm_head **738 M**.

Bytes per token by storage (QS4CX_WH 0.5 B/w + ≈ 34 KB of scale / colsum
per expert; Q4_0 0.5625 B/w; QS2CX_WH 0.25 B/w):

| kind | A: Q4_0 FCs (plan 201) | A′: #225, FCs on WH 4-bit | 2-bit |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| experts | 714 MB | 714 | **357** |
| attention | 624 | 555 | 278 |
| dense FFN | 301 | 267 | 134 |
| lm_head | 415 | 369 | 185 |

Rates: DRAM ceiling **70 GB/s** for any reader mix (rule 44 [M-LFM]); the
weight DMA alone **57** in the app (rule 43 [M-LFM]); the one-PD path's
effective rate on both kinds **≈ 44 GB/s** (rule 59 [M-LFM]: FC set
402 MB in 9.2 ms, MoE round 462 MB in 10.5 ms); the remainder outside the
byte streams on LFM one-PD **2.7 ms** (22.4 − 9.2 − 10.5), scaled to
Gemma's 30 layers and head_dim 256 / 512 attention as **≈ 4 ms [E]**.

| option (which kinds at 2 bits) | MB / token | floor at 70 GB/s | at 44 GB/s + 4 ms [E] |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| A (plan 201's row) | 2 054 | 29.3 ms → **34 tok/s** | 50.7 ms → 20 |
| A′ (#225: FC set on WH tiles, all 4-bit) | 1 905 | 27.2 → 37 | 47.3 → 21 |
| **B / C-reg, experts only** (what #4410 covers) | 1 548 | 22.1 → **45** | 39.2 → 26 |
| + attention + dense FFN at 2 bits (needs #225's WH FCs + the u8i2 kernel on the FC path) | 1 138 | 16.3 → **61** | 29.9 → 33 |
| + lm_head at 2 bits (only if the checkpoint's tied head is ternary) | 954 | 13.6 → 73 | 25.7 → 39 |

Per kind, does the floor move: **experts yes** (−357 MB, −8.1 ms at
44 GB/s: the 30 MoE rounds go ≈ 16.2 → 8.1 ms, scaling §5.18's 679 → 424 µs
per 4-expert call to 8 experts × 30 layers [G from M-4410]); **attention
and dense FFN yes but only after #225**, since the Q4M1 kernel reads Q4_0
blocks and has no 2-bit form, and the ternary checkpoint's attention /
dense weights are presumably ternary too (the user's format answer says);
**lm_head** moves the floor by 184 MB / 4.2 ms only if its weights are
ternary — with a tied embedding that is the least likely of the three
(needs-user). The scale of the bar: the experts alone leave the floor at
45, under 50; the FC set at 2 bits is what puts the floor above the bar.
The 44 GB/s column says the measured path sits at ≈ 60 % of the DRAM
ceiling; the gap (DMA 57 vs 70, the FC feed, misses) is #201 S6's
business, not this plan's.

**Which stored packing changes which number.** DDR under B / C is 2-bit
whatever the file holds, because the converter (or the loader's slot
fill) emits `QS2CX_WH`:

| checkpoint packing | file / page cache | DDR arena & per-token bytes | converter work |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2-bit (4 per byte) | 0.25 B/w | as the table | re-order into whPack2 code order, one palette {−1, 0, +1, 0} |
| 1.58-bit (5 per byte, base-3) | 0.2 B/w: experts file 2.9 → 2.3 GB | **unchanged** (2-bit in the arena; a 5-per-byte DMA format would need a base-3 unpack kernel ≈ 5 `vlut32`-sized passes per vector, ≈ 6 × B's expand [E] — not worth 20 % of the expert bytes, ≈ 1.6 ms/token at 44 GB/s) | base-3 digit extraction on the ARM at convert time; the miss read of 1.46 MiB is a `pread` of the 2-bit file region |
| int8 (one byte per ternary value) | 1 B/w: 11.4 GB of experts, page cache cannot hold it beside the arena (plan 201 §3.3) | unchanged | pack 4 per byte |
| scale per column or per tensor | — | exact in `QS2CX_WH` (`w_scale[n]`, per-tensor = broadcast) | — |
| **scale per group / block along K** | — | **not exact**: the HMX / GEMV epilogue applies one scale per column over all of K (`htp_wh_palette.h` header comment); options: (i) fold the group scale into a per-column scale with error (then SNR / PPL gates, not bit-identity), (ii) a per-group drain of the accumulator (`acc_read` cost, rejected in doc 54), (iii) C-TMAN, whose LUT bakes per-block fp16 scales (`GroupSize` 64 / 128 paths) — **needs-user** |

### 3.3 VTCM budget (C-reg and C-TMAN against the 8 MiB S1 holds)

S1 holds all 8 MiB (`hexkl_micro_hw_init`); the M=1 feed uses the whole
arena below the HMX config block as two gate_up-sized slabs with the downs
packed into them (`hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c:569-590`). The FC set's VTCM feed
(6 lanes × 2 groups) uses the same arena in turn (one PD, rule 59).

| | 4-bit Gemma | 2-bit Gemma |
|---|---:|---:|
| gate_up slab | 1.98 MB | 0.99 MB |
| down matrix | 0.99 MB | 0.50 MB |
| 2 slabs (today's feed condition) | 3.96 MB | 1.98 MB |
| 4 slabs (doc 54 §5.18.5's lever: DMA two experts ahead) | 7.9 MB — does not fit beside the config block | **3.96 MB, fits** |
| C-reg register LUT | — | 128 B per weight, a vector register (no VTCM) |
| C-TMAN activation LUT (`K / 4 × 16 × int16`) | — | 22.5 KB (K = 2816), 5.6 KB (K = 704); the `c` accumulator `N × bits × f32` 11 KB / 22.5 KB; T-MAN's `TILE_K = 256` weight tile per thread, trivial |

So the LUT tables are not the budget; the slabs are, and at 2 bits they
halve. C-reg at 2 slabs keeps the ≈ 86 µs/call exposure doc 54 measured
only if the expand stage existed — with the native kernel there is no
expand, and the feed condition `2 × feed_gu_bytes ≤ arena` holds with
room for four slabs, which is the one scheduling change worth carrying
(§4 S2).

### 3.4 Pool arithmetic (plan 201 §3.4 re-run)

| | 4-bit | 2-bit |
|---|---:|---:|
| expert slot (tiles + scale / colsum + palette, page-rounded) | 2.87 MiB | **1.46 MiB** |
| all experts (3 840 slots) | 10.6 GiB | 5.5 GiB — still not resident |
| FC set + lm_head on WH (A′) | 1 136 MiB | 745 MiB if the FCs are 2-bit |
| one PD room = 3 840 − FC set − heap 150–200 [E] | ≈ 2 500–2 550 MiB → 870–890 slots → **C ≈ 29 of 128 (23 %)** | FCs 4-bit: ≈ 1 710–1 750 slots → **C ≈ 57 (45 %)**; FCs 2-bit: ≈ 2 900–2 950 MiB → ≈ 1 990–2 020 slots → **C ≈ 66 (52 %)** |
| miss read per expert (rule 61: 0.5–1.6 ms at 5.25 MiB warm) | ≈ 0.3–0.9 ms [E, proportional] | ≈ 0.15–0.45 ms [E] |

Hit rate at these C is unknown for Gemma (plan 201 §5); the pool simulator
on S5's routing trace answers it. What is certain: the handle limit
(4 096 since S1) covers 2 020 slots, and the mapping stays under 14
windows.

### 3.5 Accuracy per option

| option | arithmetic | gate |
|---|---|---|
| A | int4 codes = the ternary values; per-column scale = the checkpoint's | bit-identical to the CPU run of the same ternary weights (the CPU `QS4CX` / Q4_0 path must read the same codes; S5's converter owns that) |
| B, C-reg | palette {−1, 0, +1, 0} → the same int4 bytes `gemm_row1` would read; `vlut32` result identical (host twin + device gtest `HvxExpandI2I4.MatchesScalarBitExact`, passed on an S25 [M-4410 §5.8]); int32 sums identical | `gemv_native_check` 0 mismatches; `moe_layer_host_check` 2-bit cell; in-process E2E `bit_identical=1` vs the 4-bit run; device MoE dumps `bit_identical=1`, text ≡ A 8 / 8 |
| C-TMAN | x → int16 LUT entries with one per-tensor scale (`max |Σ4 x| / 32767`), int16 → int32 → qf32, `(c · ls + lb) · s`, bit-plane sum in qf32 | not bit-identical: an SNR line vs f32 ≥ the 4-bit path's own (the u8 activation path reads ≈ 16–17 dB on real expert tensors, doc 54 §5.3 [M-4410 host]); then D2: decode PPL ≤ 1.02 × A, no new loop, user approval |
| per-group-scale checkpoint folded to per-column (if the user's answer is "per group") | a weight error, uniform across K | SNR vs the f32 checkpoint; PPL / loop / approval — the bit-identity gate is unavailable by construction |

Doc 54's own accuracy row (SNR 7.8 dB, "ppl not yet measured", §5.18.6)
is **not** this plan's problem: that was a 4-level palette fitted to a
4-bit model's codes; ternary weights already have three levels, so the
palette is lossless.

### 3.6 Contract §2 and doc 45 §3

Walls 1 and 2 (M=1 GEMV, DMA feed) are reused unchanged in shape; wall 3
(transport) untouched. Arena budget: the slot halves, the FC set is as
#225 leaves it, the PD heap grows by nothing (the register LUT is 128 B
per expert in the slot struct). No CPU fallback for `QS2CX_WH` (the throw
stays). DMA hidden behind compute: at 2 bits the compute : DMA ratio is
≈ 25 : 340 µs per LFM call — hidden with margin. `_det` before every
quantizer: the GEMV output feeds the same epilogue; nothing before a
quantizer changes. Bit-identical + text gates: §3.5.

## 4. Steps

Each ends in a rung of `.claude/skills/hexagon-gates`. S0 is the only
blocker; S1–S3 are host work and can start on LFM now.

* **S0. Pin the format (needs-user).** Answer needed: bits stored (2 /
  1.58 / int8), scale scope (per tensor / per column / per group of K),
  whether attention, dense FFN and the tied head are ternary too. Table
  §3.2 says what each answer changes; a per-group scale re-opens §3.5's
  last row and C-TMAN. Gate: the issue comment with the answer; S5's
  converter spec written from it.
* **S1. Port #4410's 2-bit stack onto `htp_decode`** (own PR, LFM, host
  only). Cherry-pick in order `1a6928769` (palette), `fe643e45c`
  (`QS2CX_WH`), `08f44155d` + `5aa3b4357` + `c2cdfab0a` (expand kernel,
  the `vlut32` index fix, the shuffle-free code order), `be916a261` (feed
  at 2 bits), `dfca0acbf` (native u8i2 GEMV); skip `f3874b0d8` (half-DMA
  measurement build), `0d603f29a` (resident stream) and the doc commits.
  Expected conflicts: `hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c` M=1 section (4 queues, #185
  schedule table, the pool's handle table from #201 S1), `takeExpertSlot`
  / `readWeight` (slot bytes by `bits`), the IDL (`expand_i2i4` entry —
  keep it, it is the device gate for `vlut32`). Gate: rung 1 (`ALL CHECKS
  PASS` incl. `expand_i2i4_host_check` and the 2-bit M1 GEMV cell,
  `*Lfm2Moe*` 6 / 6 plus a `QS2CX_WH` tiny-fixture line, `INPROC E2E PASS`
  with a 2-bit lfm25 fixture `bit_identical=1` against the 4-bit run through
  the pool at C = 1 / 2 / unset); rung 2 (IDL changed: skel md5, stub
  regenerated, `UNDEFINED SYMBOLS OK`, both arches).
* **S2. Gemma at 2 bits on the host.** The #231 gate \| up `QS4CX_WH`
  writer gains `bits = 2` (ternary codes → palette {−1, 0, +1, 0},
  colsum over the codes, `w_scale` = the checkpoint's column scale);
  `hvx_gemm_u8i2_wh_cols2_nopf` under the GeGLU epilogue
  (`HEXKL_MOE_FLAG_GEGLU`); the slot size and miss read by `bits`; the
  feed at four slabs when `4 × feed_gu_bytes` fits (DMA two experts
  ahead; the host scoreboard `moe_layer_host_check` proves the new
  schedule). Gate: rung 1 (`gemma64 e3 … bit_identical=1` 2-bit vs 4-bit,
  `calls/token=1.00`, tokens 8 / 8), rung 2.
* **S3. The ISS reading (cheap, host, `hexagon-sim -mv79 --timing` as
  plans 132 / 170 used it; `source tools/htp/env.sh` puts it on PATH).**
  A standalone harness in the scratchpad (not committed unless it finds
  something) calling, on VTCM-resident operands at the two Gemma shapes
  (K = 2816, N = 1408 gate \| up; K = 704, N = 2816 down), one thread:
  `gemm_row1` (4-bit), `gemm_i2_row1` / `_cols2` (C-reg), and — only to
  close the issue's question with a number — T-MAN's BitNet `hvx_tbl`
  (`hvx_funcs.h` l.538–700 compiled as-is; weights from a port of
  `hvx_preprocess_weights`, activation LUT from `hvx_lut_ctor`). Report
  pcycles per expert per lane; gate: **C-reg ≤ 0.5 × the 2-bit DMA window
  per expert** (1.49 MB / 57 GB/s = 26 µs ≈ 47 k pcycles at 1.8 GHz, i.e.
  ≤ 23 k pcycles / expert / lane at 6 lanes [G]) — pass means compute
  stays hidden and C-TMAN is closed for good; fail means C-TMAN's
  instruction count matters and gets its own issue. The ISS prices HVX
  compute right and memory-side scalar work wrong (rule 58); this harness
  has no scalar memory side, so the reading stands.
* **S4. Device sitting — unavoidable, after S5's files** (Gemma on the
  attached S26, or, as a bridge before the files, LFM on the farm S25 to
  re-read §5.18 on the one-PD pool path). Handoff
  `docs/measurements/229-2bit.md`, prompt 512, G 64 / 512 / 1024, cool
  start per G, S1 ceiling after every run; variants ≤ 4:

  | variant | what | reads |
  |---|---|---|
  | **A** | 4-bit model, one PD, pool at its largest C (unchanged reference) | tok/s, per-kind lines, text |
  | **B2** | 2-bit model, C-reg, same C as A | tok/s; `mm` is the only stage that moves (the §5.18 signature); misses a token unchanged |
  | **B2-C** | 2-bit, pool at the largest C that loads (§3.4's 57 / 66) | misses a token, ms a miss (halved?), tok/s |
  | **B2-S4** | B2-C with four slabs | `mm` vs B2-C; the two-experts-ahead DMA |

  Gate: §1's speed row; dumps `bit_identical=1`, text ≡ A 8 / 8; RSS and
  arena recorded (the 2-bit arena is the other half of the gain: −45.8 %
  peak RSS on LFM [M-4410]).

## 5. Risks

* **The scale scope** (S0). Per-group scales make every bit-identity gate
  in this plan unavailable; the plan then becomes a PPL plan (§3.5) and
  C-TMAN returns as a candidate. The handoff table shows it as the SNR
  line next to the 4-bit path's.
* **#4410 is open upstream and 491 commits behind**; its `vlut32` reading
  was gated on one S25 unit (v79). The v81 (S26) behaviour of
  `V6_vlutvvb` is unmeasured — the device gtest `HvxExpandI2I4` runs first
  on any new unit, before a tok/s cell.
* **The native u8i2 GEMV has no device number**: §5.18's +25.9 % is the
  expand path (B); C-reg's claim is host-exact only. The sitting's B2
  cell is the first reading; if `mm` does not fall to ≈ half, the stage
  lines (`expand`, `drain`, `mm`) say which assumption failed.
* **DMA rate / DVFS / thermal**: same-sitting A / B, cool start per G,
  rule 52's band; the gain is a byte count, so it should show at every G
  alike — a G-dependent gain is a thermal artefact.
* **Stale skel / stub**: the IDL changes (S1); md5s on both ends, one tree
  per sitting (rule 3).
* **Address space**: a larger pool is still under 14 windows; the ceiling
  cell after every run (rules 50, 54, 59c).
* **Hit rate** at C = 57–66 is a guess until the S5 trace; the sitting
  reads misses a token at both C.
* **Host vs device**: the host twin proves bits and the feed schedule,
  never ms; the ISS proves compute cycles, never the DMA.

## 6. Docs to update

* **`docs/htp_moe/BENCHMARK.md`**: the Gemma block gains §3.2's table
  (computed, per option, marked until S4 measures it) and, after S4, the
  A / B2 / B2-C / B2-S4 rows with RSS + arena; the LFM bridge sitting, if
  run, as one row beside #201's one-PD cells.
* **`docs/htp_moe/LEDGER.md`**: §Upstream gains PR #4410 (`0d603f29a`,
  open, what is taken and what is not); a rule candidate from S4 ("at
  M = 1 the GEMV is DDR-bound, so 2-bit weights buy the halved DMA
  column and nothing else — +25.9 % on LFM, doc 54 §5.18; the register
  LUT keeps the int32 sums"); plan 194 L10's "revisit only if a 2–3-bit
  format is adopted" closed by this plan; open item: the per-group-scale
  consequence until S0 answers.
* **Plan 201 §3.2 / §3.4**: the Gemma columns re-pointed at this plan's
  2-bit rows; S6's lever list gains "FC set at 2 bits after #225".
* **Contract `0001` §12**: the user's S0 answer as a dated row.

## 7. S7 — the 2 GB budget (a later stage; nothing in S1–S5 or in plan 234's port order depends on it)

**User, 2026-10-06:** peak memory (process RSS including the ION arenas)
under 2 GB, the rest streamed from flash — to be considered **last**, after
the ternary 26B decodes end to end on the device. Issue #234 asked for the
arithmetic to be on record now; this section is that record and nothing
more. §3.4's pool numbers (C ≈ 57–66) assumed a 3.8 GB arena and are
superseded here for the 2 GB case only. Tags as §0; **[M-4408]** = doc 55
§10.14 on `refs/pr/4408` (S25, 4-bit experts, hybrid path, one prompt).

### 7.1 Resident bytes per kind, 26B-A4B (MiB)

### 7.2 The largest pool under 2 048 MiB

Fixed part, with the two ARM copies gone (embedding mmap'd, no FC
originals — both are required: with them the FC arena alone overflows):
ARM 240 + heap 150 + router 41 + KV 240 (window 1024 + global 4096) =
**671 MiB**.

| configuration | fixed + FC set + lm_head | pool room | slots (1.453) | **C of 128** | prefill read-ahead (30 C ≥ 128 + slack) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| experts 2-bit, FCs 4-bit, lm_head 4-bit | 671 + 790 + 352 = 1 813 | 235 | 161 | **5** | at the R2 floor; no slack (doc 55 §10.11: C = 5 lost the read-ahead, prefill 40.9 vs 89.3 TPS) |
| experts + FCs 2-bit, lm_head 4-bit | 671 + 395 + 352 = 1 418 | 630 | 433 | **14** | yes |
| everything 2-bit | 671 + 395 + 176 = 1 242 | 806 | 554 | **18** | yes |
| (KV at max_seq 4096 instead of the window) | + 600 | − 413 slots | | C − 13 | the KV window sizing is worth 13 experts a layer |

### 7.3 Misses a token and the decode floor

Hit rate: the only Gemma points are [M-4408] — misses over 512 generated
tokens 81 348 / 62 198 / 41 955 at C = 8 / 16 / 24 → **159 / 121 / 82
misses a token** of 240 routed uses (hit 34 / 49 / 66 %), hybrid LRU, 4-bit
weights, one prompt; LFM's curve (57 / 73 / 85 % at C = 8 / 12 / 16 of 32,
doc 53 §5) has the same shape at the same C / E. Interpolated [E]: C = 5
≈ 170, C = 14 ≈ 130, C = 18 ≈ 110 misses a token.

Cost of one miss at 1.453 MiB [E, scaled from measured rates]: cold UFS
3.0 GB/s (doc 53 §5.5 [M-up]) → **0.5 ms**; the uncached-ION store cap
4.9 GB/s (`readWeight`'s comment, plan 219 §0.1) → 0.3 ms — this is the
warm floor on this path; doc 55 §10.14's warm 0.76 ms per 2.87 MiB (3.9
GB/s) → 0.38 ms; LFM's best warm 0.31–0.37 ms per 5.25 MiB (plan 201
§3.3) → 0.1 ms is a cached-staging rate the ION slot does not reach.

| configuration | DDR term a token (§3.2, 44 GB/s + 4 ms [E]; at 70 GB/s in brackets) | miss bytes a token | miss term cold / warm (0.5 / 0.3 ms) | **floor cold / warm** |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| C = 5, FCs 4-bit | 39.2 (22.1) ms | 170 × 1.453 = 247 MiB | 85 / 51 ms | 124 ms → **8 tok/s** / 90 → 11 |
| C = 14, FCs 2-bit | 29.9 (16.3) | 189 MiB | 65 / 39 | 95 → **11** / 69 → 14 |
| C = 18, all 2-bit | 25.7 (13.6) | 160 MiB | 55 / 33 | 81 → **12** / 59 → 17 |
| for scale: §3.4's C = 66 (3.8 GB arena), hit ≈ 85–90 % [E] | 25.7 | 35–52 MiB | 12–18 / 7–11 | 38–44 → 23–26 / 33–37 → 27–30 |

Under 2 GB the floor is **miss-bound, ≈ 8–17 tok/s**: the flash term is
1.3–2× the DDR term, and the serial miss read is the wall. The page cache
— not RSS, but the whole difference between the cold and the warm column —
needs ≈ 5.5 GiB for the 2-bit expert region; on a 12 GB phone with ≈ 3.7 GB
of Android and 2 GB of ours that is at the edge, so "warm" is a measurement,
not a plan (rule 61's `pgpgin` / refault columns on every cell).

### 7.4 What flash streaming buys, and which levers matter when the pool is small

It buys the run itself: 2-bit experts alone are 5.5 GiB resident, so under
2 GB there is no all-resident option. The cost is the factor 2–3 above
between the 2 GB floor and the 3.8 GB one. Levers, largest first [E]:

1. **No ARM copy of any NPU-resident weight; the embedding mmap'd** —
   1 284 MiB = 884 slots = C + 29; without it nothing fits (§7.2).
2. **FCs (and the head) at 2 bits** — C 5 → 14 → 18 (§7.2); the same
   code path as §3.2's floor 45 → 61.
3. **KV sized by the sliding window** — C + 13 at max_seq 4096.
4. **Keep the misses warm** — 0.5 → 0.3 ms a miss, −20 to −34 ms a
   token; it is page-cache policy, outside RSS: `NNTR_MOE_FADVISE`'s
   WILLNEED-on-evict (rule 62: 2–10 ms a call on the S25, prefill
   −7..−18 % — re-read on Gemma, not adopted).
5. **Read-ahead from the previous token's routing (P-D)** and **misses
   under the hits' compute (P-A)**: they hide, they do not shrink —
   P-A hides ≤ the hit experts' DMA of the layer (≈ 8 ms of 55–85), P-D
   the previous token's whole compute but at a 64 % routing-prediction
   ceiling on LFM (doc 53 §7 [M-up]); with 110–170 misses a token both
   are worth ≈ 10–20 ms, less than lever 4 and only after it.
6. **Four slabs** (§3.3): a DDR-term lever (≈ −1 to −2 ms); irrelevant to
   the misses.
7. **#219's ARM tier does not fit**: the complement is 3 840 − 554 =
   3 286 experts = 4.7 GiB, and any capped tier slot costs the same 1.453
   MiB as a pool slot while serving a hit at 0.3 ms instead of 0 — under
   an RSS cap a tier slot is strictly worse than a pool slot. Off under
   2 GB.

Open, for S7 proper: the real `RSS 766` decomposition on the device (one
`smaps` read of an LFM run settles the 240), the sliding-cache sizing in
the attention op, whether the loader can skip the CPU originals when every
kind is resident, and S5's own routing trace for the hit curve.

## 8. S2 revision 2, 2026-10-08 — the FC / head 2-bit step after #234 P4

Supersedes §4 S2 (the "Gemma at 2 bits on the host" bullet) and the FC
/ head rows of §3.2 for what comes next; §3.3, §3.4 and §7 stand. Inputs:
the P4 sitting `docs/measurements/234-p4-fcwh-decode.md` on
`origin/htp/234-p4-fcwh-decode` @ `a7fe77748` (PR #257, S25 `R3CY205ZMND`,
dummy weights, prompt 447, C 16), plan 234 §3, LEDGER rules 71 / 72, ㉞ /
㉟, S5-0. Tags as §0; **[M-P4]** = that sitting's G 512 F16 cells (mean of
r1–r3). Code references are to the P4 branch unless marked `[htp_decode]`.

### 8.1 Lever ranking from the P4 breakdown

Bytes a token on the DSP today (F16 = one PD, FC / DENSE_FFN on the 4-bit
sidecar, LM_HEAD Q4M1, experts `QS2CX_WH`), from the config [G] against
the per-kind ms [M-P4]:

| kind | what is read | MB / token [G] | ms [M-P4] | GB/s [G] |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| FC | attention q \| k \| v, o: 1 110 M w × 0.5 B + 8 B × 335 360 cols | 557.8 | 10.65 | **52.4** |
| DENSE_FFN | up, gate, down: 535 M w × 0.5 B + 8 B × 211 200 cols | 269.3 | 5.33 | 50.5 |
| LM_HEAD | tied head Q4_0, 262 144 × 2 816 × 18 / 32 | 415.2 | 8.18 | 50.8 |
| MOE | 240 experts × (5.95 M w / 4 + 8 B × 4 224) | 365.0 | 11.19 (10.4 net of 0.71 miss × 1.1 ms) | 32.6 (35) |
| ATTN_M1 | KV fp16, 225 KB a context position, mean ctx 703 | ≈ 158 | 13.74 | ≈ 13 (slope 17 µs / position from the G 64 / 512 / 1024 cells: 9.56 / 13.74 / 17.73 ms at mean ctx 479 / 703 / 959) |
| ROUTER_TOPK | 30 × [2 816 × 128] f32 | 43 | 4.04 | ≈ 11 |
| RMSNORM + QK_NORM + ROPE + ADD | — | — | 2.9 | — |
| **DSP wall** | | **≈ 1 810** | **56.45** | |

The token is 62.9 ms (15.89 tok/s), so ≈ 6.5 ms a token is ARM, transport
and miss wait. **The WH read rate on this path is ≈ 52 GB/s** (attention
557.8 MB / 10.65 ms; dense agrees at 50.5) — above rule 59's 44, under rule
44's 70, and the same as the Q4M1 head's 50.8: the P4 move bought bytes
(0.5625 → 0.5 B/w, −11 %) plus the kernel's rate (E16's FC was 14.33 ms for
the same bytes at Q4_0 = 44 GB/s), not a new ceiling. Every lever below is
priced at 52 GB/s.

| lever | bytes before → after (MB) | ms before → after | gain (ms) | note |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **1. FC + dense → 2-bit** (sidecar `bits = 2`, u8i2 column branch) | 827.2 → 415.8 (+ 4 palette B / image) | 15.98 → 8.0 | **−8.0 [G]** | the kernel exists (`hvx_gemm_u8i2_wh_col_nopf`, `hvx_gemm_u8i4_wh.h:100`); the DENSE_FFN WH path already runs the MoE kernel, whose 2-bit feed lands packed rows (`hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c:1120`) |
| 2a. LM_HEAD → WH 4-bit | 415.2 → 371.2 | 8.18 → 7.1 | −1.0 [G] | bind + runner work (§8.4); costs +371 MiB of arena because the ARM keeps its Q4_0 table for the embedding lookup (today the head is *attached*, `attach_mib=396`, no second copy) |
| 2b. LM_HEAD → WH 2-bit | 415.2 → 186.6 | 8.18 → 3.6 | −4.6 [G] | only if the tied embedding is ternary — **needs-user** (§3.2's caveat stands) |
| 3. attention window (㉞ a) | KV scan capped at 1 024 positions on the 25 sliding layers | at G 512 (ctx ≤ 959): 0; at G 1024: ≤ 92 MB at the last token | 0 at the headline cell; ≈ −1.7 mean at G 1024 [G] | a memory lever first: KV 800 → 200 MiB at `max_seq` 4096, which is rule 71's C lever. ATTN_M1's real cost is its 13 GB/s (−9 ms if it read at the WH rate [E]) — S6's, not this plan's |
| 4. MOE 4-slab feed (§3.3) | 365, unchanged | 10.4 → ≥ 7.0 | ≤ −3.4, expect −2 [E] | the only 2-bit kind left with a rate gap (35 vs 52 GB/s); DMA two experts ahead now fits (3.96 MB of 8 MiB) |

If 1 + 2a + 4 land: 56.45 − 8.0 − 1.0 − 2.0 = 45.5 ms DSP + 6.5 → 52 ms
→ **≈ 19.2 tok/s** [G/E]; with 2b instead of 2a ≈ 20.7. Lever 1 alone:
54.9 ms → 18.2 tok/s, level with the hybrid A16 (18.37 [M-P4]). **Lever 1
buys the most**: it is the largest byte stream on the DSP (827 of 1 810 MB,
46 %), it halves, the GEMV is DDR-bound (§3.1: 25 µs of compute against
340 µs of DMA per LFM call), and the kernel and the feed-by-`bits`
plumbing exist — what is missing is a format field and a column branch.
The 50 bar is out of this plan's reach by arithmetic: ATTN_M1 13.7 +
ROUTER 4.0 + norms 2.9 + ARM 6.5 = 27 ms of non-weight time a token caps
the path at 37 tok/s with zero weight bytes; §3.2's floor 61 assumed 4 ms
of remainder. The bar is S6's (kernel rates), the next 3–4 tok/s are S2's.

### 8.2 The FC source format (needs-user)

What the P4 accuracy flag means. Q4_0's block scale is `d = max / −8`
(`nntr_ggml_impl_quant.cpp:402`, `fallback_internal.cpp:1245` [C]): a
32-block holding both +s and −s stores one sign at 7s/8. For a ternary FC
every block of a column holds both signs, so **Q4_0 is lossy for ternary
by construction** (12.5 % on half the non-zeros), and P4's tool then
re-quantizes those values per column — two roundings. The dummy's
+12.6 % ppl is this stack on random weights; on real weights the size is
unknown but the mechanism is certain.

| option | producer emits | sidecar | exact for ternary | CPU prefill / hybrid A | cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** (recommended) | FCs as **`QS4CX`** in the main file: per-column int4 codes + f32 scale (`quantize_stream.cpp:471`, the `writeFc` dtype list `:386`) | a **repack**: `whPack` (bits 4) or `whPack2` + palette (bits 2 when every code ∈ {−1, 0, +1}); no quantization in the tool | yes: codes {−1, 0, +1} × s_col, identical bytes on both sides | the CPU runs `QS4CX` natively (KleidiAI qsi4cx GEMV / GEMM, `float_tensor.cpp:1136-1140`; `fc_layer.cpp:223`) — one set of values for prefill, the hybrid A and the NPU decode | writer: none (dtype exists); tool: a `QS4CX` reader; loader: the Gemma hand-over accepts a `QS4CX` FC (§8.3 S2.2); **open**: the KleidiAI prefill rate vs Q4_0's (the −5 % rule reads it) |
| B (P4 today) | Q4_0 | re-quantized per column | no (two roundings) | Q4_0 | none; fails the +2 % ppl rule on the dummy; unbounded on real files |
| C | Q4_0 | per-32-group scales in the WH image | no (Q4_0's 7/8 stays) | Q4_0 | a new GEMV (per-k-tile accumulator drain — doc 54 rejected `acc_read`; or f32 accumulation off `vrmpyacc`), image +6 % (K/32 × N f16 scales), a new `fc_wh_det.h` spec + mutant, no HMX form for the LFM prefill half (one scale per column in the HMX epilogue); and for ternary it buys nothing a per-column scale does not already hold |

**Recommend A.** Fallback A′ if the KleidiAI prefill fails the −5 % rule:
Q4_0 main file + the sidecar written **from the source** (P3's
`--fc_wh_sidecar` path) — one rounding each side, prefill and decode on
different FC values, the hybrid A lossy at 7/8; still better than B.

**Producer spec to forward (option A).** Either (A1) hand us the source
tensors (bf16 / f32 of `ternary × scale`, or the ternary codes + per-column
scale) as safetensors and `nntr_quantize_stream --fc_dtype QS4CX
--moe_dtype QS2CX_WH --fc_wh_sidecar` writes both files; or (A2) emit the
`.bin` directly, in `writeGemma4Moe` order (`quantize_stream.cpp:1301-1352`
[C]): `embedding0`; per layer `layer<i>_attention_norm`, `_wq`, `_q_norm`,
`_wk`, `_k_norm`, `_wv` (sliding layers only — full layers have
`attention_k_eq_v`), `_attention_out`, `_post_attention_norm`,
`_pre_ffn_norm`, `_ffn_gate`, `_ffn_up`, `_ffn_down`, `_post_ffn_norm_1`,
`_pre_ffn_norm_2`, `_sparse_moe router`, `router_scale`, then the experts
as today. Each FC `[K × N]` (K = input width) as `QS4CX`: `N` rows of
`K / 2` bytes of int4 codes (two per byte, low nibble first, value − 8 …
i.e. the `layer_devel.h` QS4CX save layout), then `N` f32 per-column
scales; ternary → codes {−1, 0, +1} exactly, scale = the checkpoint's
column scale. The tied head stays the embedding's dtype (Q4_0 or, if the
head is ternary, the same `QS4CX` — then lever 2b opens). Experts unchanged
(`QS2CX_WH`, PR #251's repack). The 2-bit sidecar image is ours to derive;
the producer never writes 2-bit FCs (no CPU kernel: `float_tensor.cpp:775`).

### 8.3 Steps (option A)

Each ends in a rung of `.claude/skills/hexagon-gates`; the IDL does not
change (`weight_register_u2i4_arena` exists, `nntr_hvx.idl:1055`
[htp_decode]), so no stub regeneration; rung 2 for the DSP sources.

* **S2.0 — needs-user.** The §8.2 decision and the producer spec
  forwarded; whether the tied head is ternary. Gate: the #229 comment;
  contract §12 row.
* **S2.1 — sidecar v2 + writers (host, no DSP).** `htp_wh_layout.h`:
  `FCWH_VERSION 2`, `FCWH_FORMAT "QSxCX_WH/2"`, `FcWhEntry.bits` (the
  static_assert moves with it; v1 files refused by the version check,
  `htp_compute_ops.cpp:2951` — one format per tree, rule 3). Image at
  bits 2 = the `QS2CX_WH` tensor layout `[K·N/4 codes][4 palette][N f32
  scale][N f32 colsum]` (`qs4cx_tensor.h:325`). `nntr_quantize_stream
  --fc_wh_sidecar` picks bits 2 per tensor when its per-column codes are
  all in {−1, 0, +1} (palette {−1, 0, 1, 0}), else 4; LFM's FCs are not
  ternary, so its sidecar stays bits 4 and its lines read as before.
  `tools/htp/fc_wh_sidecar_from_q4.py` gains the `QS4CX` main-file reader
  (repack, same bits rule); its Q4_0 mode stays for the dummy, marked
  lossy in its banner. Fixtures: `gemma64x` (int4-exact FCs, the FC SNR
  gate) plus a ternary twin `gemma64t` (codes clamped to {−1, 0, +1} at
  f32 generation, so Q4_0, `QS4CX` and both sidecar widths hold the same
  values). Gate rung 1: `FcWhSidecarMatchesWhQuantize` extended (`*Lfm2Moe*`
  still 7 / 7 + the Gemma count), a host check `whPack2 + expand ==
  whPack` on every image (`expand_i2i4_host_check` reused), `E2E quant
  fcwh-gemma64t main=same images=<n> bits2=<n> ok`.
* **S2.2 — loader (host).** `registerFcWh` (`htp_compute_ops.cpp:5312`)
  sizes by `bits` (`codeBytes` + `paletteBytes` + 8 N, `:5833-5840`), fills
  `ArenaEntry.pal`, so the existing register call picks
  `weight_register_u2i4_arena` (`:6748`); `fcwhLeft` (`:6819`) by bits;
  the heap overflow path (`NNTR_HTP_FC_WH_HEAP=1`) expands on the host
  and registers 4-bit (`ponytail:` doubles those bytes; the E2E chunk
  never takes it). Gemma hand-over: `Q4Pending` (`:7012`) carries a dtype,
  `gemma4_moe_causallm.cpp:231` admits `QS4CX` FCs, and `bindQ4m1`'s
  non-WH branch refuses a `QS4CX` FC with no sidecar entry (no Q4M1 /
  CPU fallback, contract §2). Gate rung 1: `E2E fwd gemma64t fcwh
  kinds=all calls/token=1.00 attn_caches=2 q4m1_handles=1 wh_handles=<n>
  bits2=<n>`, `GRAPH FC WH OK` / `MUTANT CAUGHT` unchanged.
* **S2.3 — the u8i2 FC column branch (DSP).** `hexkl_mm_u8i4_fc_m1_run`
  (`hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.c:2792`): drop the `w->bits == 2u` refusal (`:2816`);
  per part a 128 B LUT from `hvx_expand_i2i4_table(w->pal, …)` in the
  scratch carve (32 × 128 B); `fc_m1_push` row and source stride halved
  at bits 2 (the `:1120` pattern — the 2D descriptor lands packed rows);
  `fc_m1_worker` calls `hvx_gemm_u8i2_wh_col_nopf` (fed) /
  `hvx_gemm_u8i2_wh_col` (unfed) with the part's LUT; `col_bytes` by bits
  so `fit` doubles. Per-part bits (q \| k \| v may mix). DENSE_FFN needs
  no kernel change (`moe_all_2bit`, `:677`). `fc_wh_det.h` gains the 2-bit
  twin (expand the codes, then the 4-bit spec — same int32 sums) and its
  mutant; `moe_layer_host_check` FC WH cell at bits 2 `bitwise
  mismatches=0` against the 4-bit image of the same codes, scoreboard
  unchanged. Gate rung 1 (`FC WH BIT-IDENTICAL bits=2 …`, `FC WH MUTANT
  CAUGHT`, `E2E tokens gemma64t-fcwh2==fcwh4 8/8 expected_mismatch=0`,
  `E2E eval … bit_identical=1` 2-bit token vs 4-bit token, `E2E e3 pool
  C=2 gemma64t-fcwh == e3 bit_identical=1`), rung 2 (skel v79 + v81,
  `UNDEFINED SYMBOLS OK`, stub unchanged), rung 3 before the sitting.
* **S2.4 — deferred: LM_HEAD on WH.** Opens only on a "head is ternary"
  answer (2b, −4.6 ms); at 4 bits it is −1.0 ms for +371 MiB of arena and
  the §8.4 bind work. Not in this sitting.
* **S2.5 — the device sitting (unavoidable; on the real files, S5's).**
  Handoff `docs/measurements/229-s2-fcwh2.md`, same runner shape as
  `234-p4-run.sh`; prompt 512 if the config's `sample_input` allows, else
  447 as P4; G 64 / 512 / 1024, cool start per G, A first, then T and F
  alternating order across blocks; `.sitting.lock`; S1 ceiling after
  every run; RSS + arena bytes (㉟).

  | variant | what | reads |
  |---|---|---|
  | **A16** | hybrid on the option-A main file (`QS4CX` FCs on the CPU) | reference: tok/s, prefill, text / PPL; its prefill also against P4's A16 (126–134) — the KleidiAI question |
  | **F16** | one PD, 4-bit sidecar repacked from the same file | P4's cell on exact weights: FC 10.65 / DENSE 5.33 must repeat; PPL vs A now meaningful (cause 1 of P4 gone) |
  | **T16** | one PD, 2-bit sidecar | the cell |
  | T-C | T at the largest C that loads (rule 71: start from the KV bytes) | misses a token, ms a miss |

  Gates: T16 tokens == F16 over the whole run and `NNTR_HTP_DUMP` logits
  rms(T − F) = 0 (same codes, same int32 sums — the plan's bit-identity
  gate, now between two NPU runs); F16 / T16 vs A16 by the plan 130 §3.5
  policy **and** decode PPL ≤ 1.02 × A (the per-token-entry rule P4 waived
  on the dummy, applied here); prefill of F / T ≥ 0.95 × A16 same sitting;
  speed: **T16 ≥ 17.5 tok/s at G 512** (70 % of lever 1's −8.0 ms on
  15.89) and FC ≤ 6.0 ms, DENSE_FFN ≤ 3.0 ms with every other kind inside
  noise (the §5.18 signature); the WH chunk ≈ 420 MiB (`fcwhLeft`). On
  the dummy only a speed pre-read is possible (a 2-bit sidecar clamped
  from the 4-bit one's codes; no tokens / PPL column), if the files are
  late.

**Status 2026-10-08 (implementer, branch `htp/229-s2-fc-2bit`).** S2.1–S2.3
host-gated (rungs 1–3); S2.4 and S2.5 open. Two corrections to the text
above, found in the code: (1) `quant_qs4cx_f32` spreads a column's range over
[−8, 7], so a ternary column came out as codes {−8, 0, 7} at 2s/15 — route
A1 of §8.2 was not lossless; the writer now stores a row whose values are
{−s, 0, +s} (within 1e−6 s) as codes {−1, 0, +1} × s (`ternaryRowsExact`,
QS4CX and QS4CX_WH alike), and route A2 needs no quantizer; (2) Q4_0 is lossy
for ternary (§8.2), so `gemma64t` is quantized with QS4CX FCs only, not
"Q4_0, QS4CX and both widths". `FCWH_FORMAT` is `QSxCX_WH/2`; the 4-bit twin
is `fc_wh_sidecar_from_q4.py --bits4`. A 2-bit FC handle is decode-only (the
FC prefill's layer kernel reads four bits); a keyed FC layer with a 2-bit
image is refused at load.

### 8.4 Risks

* **VTCM at M = 1, 2-bit FC**: none new. `fc_m1_worker` double-buffers
  `k_tiles × 256 B` columns per lane (K 2 816: 22.5 KB a column tile,
  `per_lane` ≈ 0.97 MiB → `fit` 21 instead of 10); the LUT is one HVX
  register from a 128 B scratch table; nothing is expanded in VTCM. The
  exposed first block of each lane (`FC_M1_BLOCKS` 4) halves with the bytes.
* **LM_HEAD at 262 144 rows** (if S2.4 opens): `fcSliceCols(2816)` = 1 472
  cols → 179 parts against `HTP_GRAPH_MAX_PARTS` / `HEXKL_FC_M1_MAX_PARTS`
  32 (`htp_graph_desc.h:62`, `hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe.h:269`) — the head needs an
  8 192-col slice (11.5 MiB a handle, 32 parts exactly) and
  `graph_op_lm_head` (`hexkl_graph.c:540`) the FC's WH branch (`:468`)
  before its softcap / ban / argmax; plus the ARM-side Q4_0 copy or a
  row-from-tiles lookup. Handles: 16 + 435 today; +32 − 16 with the head;
  the pool adds 2 a slot (C 16 → 960, C 40 → 2 400); the 4 096 table
  (`hexkl_mm_u8i4_dma.h:38`) binds at C ≈ 60, above rule 71's heap-bound
  C 40, so not before ㉞ a lands.
* **Arena sum vs plan 234 §3**: today pool 704 + WH chunk 832 + FC arena
  448 = 1 984 MiB mapped; after S2 ≈ 704 + 420 + 448 = 1 572 (head still
  attached Q4M1); with S2.4 at 4 bits ≈ 704 + 420 + 371 = 1 495 but +371
  of RSS. The ceiling 3 840 is not what binds — rule 71's DSP heap (KV
  400 + 40 MiB) is, so S2 frees address space it cannot spend on C until
  ㉞ a.
* **`FCWH_FORMAT` bump**: every v1 sidecar (the device's
  `nntr_gemma4_qs2cx_wh_fcwh.bin`, the lfm25 / gemma64 fixtures' files)
  is refused by `transformer.cpp:591`; the fixtures are regenerated by
  `run_inproc_e2e.sh` itself, the device file by the handoff's recipe;
  md5s on both ends, one tree per sitting (rule 3). A skel older than S2.3
  refuses a 2-bit FC handle with `AEE_EBADITEM` at the first token — the
  stale-skel symptom to name in the handoff (rule 67).
* **The CPU `QS4CX` prefill rate** is unmeasured against Q4_0 (rule 46:
  51–63 GB/s on Q4_0); the −5 % rule in S2.5 is where it shows; fallback
  A′ (§8.2).
* **Cause 2 of P4 stays**: the WH GEMV's u8 per-row activation (sliding
  q / k at 9.5 dB on a peaked softmax, `run_inproc_e2e.sh:451-458`). S2
  does not touch it; the real-file PPL column is where it is read, and a
  failure there is its own issue (the FC's own `_det` spec, not a format).
* **Host vs device**: the host proves bytes and the schedule, the ISS
  (§4 S3) compute cycles; the 52 GB/s and the −8.0 ms are the sitting's
  to confirm, same-sitting A / F / T, cool start per G, rule 52's band.

### 8.5 Docs to update

* **BENCHMARK.md** Gemma block: the §8.1 lever table (computed, marked
  until S2.5), then A16 / F16 / T16 / T-C rows with RSS, arena, WH chunk.
* **LEDGER.md**: rule candidates — "the one-PD WH FC read rate on the
  S25 is ≈ 52 GB/s, the Q4M1 head's 50.8: a format move buys bytes, not
  rate" [M-P4]; "Q4_0 is lossy for ternary by `d = max / −8`; a ternary
  FC's CPU format is `QS4CX`"; ㉞ a re-pointed as a C lever (rule 71), ≤
  1.7 ms at G 1024; the S0 answer row; plan 234 §3's arena sum re-stated
  as §8.4's.
* **Plan 234**: P4's "S2 lands after P4" bullet → this section; the
  `registerFcWh` / `fc_m1_run` `ponytail:` lines retire with S2.2 / S2.3.
* **Contract `0001` §12**: the user's §8.2 answer, dated.
