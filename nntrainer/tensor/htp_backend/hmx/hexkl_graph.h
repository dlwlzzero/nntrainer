 * @brief  The session's validated decode op table and its forward loop
 *         (#85), with the small ops and m=1 attention resident (#130),
 *         the residual add and the router (#132)
 * @see    https://github.com/nntrainer/nntrainer
 * @author dlwlzzero <dlwlzzero@gmail.com>
 * @bug    No known bugs except for NYI items
 *
 * "The DSP owns the graph" (LEDGER section 4, hvx_impl's htp_graph.c
 * lifted to this tree's kernels): graph_init validates the op list once
 * (htp_graph_desc.h) and binds its weight handles against the session's
 * table; forward then runs `for op from start: if !resident break;
 * table[kind]()` and reports where it stopped. The kernel table holds
 * MOE (hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe_layer_run unchanged), RMSNORM / QK_NORM / ROPE /
 * CONV1D_GATE (#82's hvx_m1_ops_f32.c), ATTN_M1 (#81's
 * hvx_attn_m1_f32.c over the session's cache, borrowed through the env),
 * ADD (hvx_scale_add_rows_f32 at scale 1 into slot 0, the residual) and
 * ROUTER_TOPK (hvx_router_topk_f32, whose routing the next MOE op
 * consumes in the same call; #132). The small ops' parameters -- gammas,
 * conv weights, the conv state seed, the RoPE table, the router weight
 * and bias -- are bound once after init through
 * hexkl_graph_set_param (plan 130 section 3.1); forward refuses an op
 * whose parameter is missing with AEE_EBADSTATE.
 *
 * [plan 201 S1] A MOE op's expert handles are its EXPERTS table, bound
 * after init like a parameter and replaceable at any time: the expert
 * pool's (layer, expert) -> handle map, HTP_GRAPH_NO_HANDLE for an expert
 * that is not resident. forward hands the table to the kernel as its
 * handle arrays (the kernel skips an expert with no rows before it reads
 * its handle) and refuses a token that routes to a non-resident expert.
 *
 * [#132 Part B] FC, DENSE_FFN and LM_HEAD: the Android CPU's M=1 Q4_0 FC
 * bit for bit (q4_gemv_cpu_det.h) -- hvx_q4m1_prep quantizes the op's
 * input once (hvx_intrin, = q8_0_quant_cpu_det) and the session's FC
 * runner (the env's fc callback: nntr_hvx_fc_q4.c's lanes and weight
 * feed) runs each Q4M1 part on it. DENSE_FFN is up, gate,
 * m1_swiglu_cpu_det (neon::swiglu's order), a second quantization and
 * down; LM_HEAD is its slices into the graph's logits buffer, then
 * m1_argmax_first (std::max_element) into lm_id. The weights are Q4M1
 * handles of the session's table bound in the op record before
 * graph_init (htp_graph_desc.h), checked there against the shapes the
 * caller passes.
 *
 * [#225] An FC or DENSE_FFN with HTP_GRAPH_FEED_WH reads WH handles of the
 * session's u8i4 table instead (the prefill's, from the FC WH sidecar):
 * the FC through hexkl_mm_u8i4_fc_m1_run, the DENSE_FFN through
 * hexkl_mm_u8i4_moe_layer_run as its chunks at weight 1 -- the kernels
 * the MOE op calls, so no fc runner is involved and the LM_HEAD alone
 * stays Q4M1.
