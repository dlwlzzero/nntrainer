 * @brief  A whole MoE FFN layer -- every expert -- in one call
 * @see    https://github.com/nntrainer/nntrainer
 * @author SeungHui Lee <shsh1004.lee@samsung.com>
 * @bug    No known bugs except for NYI items
 *
 * Design, and the arithmetic every constant here is checked against:
 * docs/htp_attention/46_moe_resident_kernel_design.md.
 *
 * Two things about this file are deliberate and easy to undo by accident.
 *
 * THE WEIGHTS ARE NOT DOUBLE-BUFFERED. Two copies of gate_up and down is
 * 10.5 MB against an 8.3 MB arena, so instead each buffer is reused with a
 * time offset: while expert e's down matmul runs, the gate_up buffer is
 * already dead and e+1's gate_up is pulled into it. That is the whole
 * reason the layout fits, and it is what keeps the weight DMA hidden --
 * doc 44 section 14.3 measured what happens when it is not: the u8in call
 * has no activation quant for the DMA to hide behind and all 5.18 ms/layer
 * of it is exposed.
 *
 * THE POOL RUNS ONE JOB BEHIND THE HMX, AND THE DOWN MATMUL ONE BLOCK
 * BEHIND THE GATE_UP. Each staged batch's epilogue (dequant+SwiGLU, or
 * dequant+scatter) is submitted to the worker pool and retired only when
 * the buffer it reads or writes is about to be reused: two accumulator
 * staging buffers alternate under the HMX issue, two mid buffers under the
 * requantization, res_f32 has its own region rather than aliasing gate.
 * Block n's down is issued after block n+1's gate_up, so that block n's
 * requantization and last epilogues have a matmul to hide behind (the
 * comment above the block loop derives it). Every wait is placed where
 * the dependency actually is, and each is timed, so the profile's
 * DEQUANT, REQUANT and SCATTER columns read the exposed part, not the
 * work. Moving a submit or a wait without re-deriving who reads what is
 * how this breaks -- silently, as a plausible wrong output.

/**
 * @brief A down batch's epilogue as ONE pool job: each staged tile

 *        block's first down batch, the NEXT block's requantization of
 *        gate_off into the other mid buffer, in MOE_RQ_UNIT_ROWS-row
 *        units.
 *
 * Why not a scatter job after the last dequant and a requantization of
 * its own, as it was: the foreground lane holds one job at a time, and a
 * job hides only when an HMX batch is issued between its submit and the
 * wait that retires it. Neither had one -- REQUANT read 0.7-1.0 ms of a
 * 15 ms prefill call and the last dequant and scatter 0.3 more (doc 51
 * section 2.21). Folded in, a block submits exactly as many jobs as it
 * issues batches.
 *
 * Why the fold is exact: a tile's 32 columns of every output row are its
 * own, so no two units write one address, and each output element still
 * receives one multiply-add per expert, in block order, since blocks'
 * jobs are sequential -- the bytes are the row split's. The requant
 * units read gate_off, which every gate_up epilogue has finished writing
 * by the wait before this job's submit, and write the mid buffer the
 * next down will read, not the one this down's HMX is reading. Work is
 * dealt round-robin over the workers so the few heavy requant units do
 * not all land on one.
 *
 * ponytail: the scatter is 64 one-vector calls per tile where the row
 * split made 64 calls of 64 vectors; a tile-shaped scale-add would trim
 * the call overhead if the DN epilogue ever shows above its batch.

 * staging below is shared. If tails ever outrun the shadow, two staging
 * sets and pairwise gating is the upgrade. And the threshold is a guess

   *   GU(0) rq(0) | GU(1) DN(0) | GU(2) DN(1) | ... | GU(N-1) DN(N-2) | DN(N-1)

   * The foreground lane runs one job at a time, and a job hides only when
   * an HMX batch is issued between its submit and the wait that retires
   * it (doc 47 section 14). In block order -- GU(n) then DN(n) -- three
   * jobs a block had nothing to hide behind: the last gate_up epilogue
   * (rq needs all of gate_off), rq itself, and the last down epilogue
   * with the scatter after it; 1.5-2 ms of a 15 ms prefill call (doc 51
   * section 2.21). One block behind, DN(n-1)'s batches cover GU(n)'s last
   * epilogue and rq(n), and GU(n+1)'s first covers DN(n-1)'s last. rq(n)
   * rides inside DN(n-1)'s first epilogue job and the scatter inside every
   * down epilogue (moe_dn_worker), so a block submits exactly as many jobs
   * as it issues batches; what stays exposed is the two ends of the call.
   *
   * What the reorder needs. Two mid buffers, DN(n-1) reading one while
   * rq(n) writes the other, with two sets of row params. down[e] pushed
   * after DN(prev) has issued, not before GU(e)'s first block: a new
   * expert's down would otherwise land on the one DN(prev) still reads.
   * The staging parity (sb) carried across gate_up and down batches: a
   * staging buffer is free once the epilogue that read it is retired,
   * which is the wait one issue back whichever phase that was. gate_off
   * stays single, because rq(n) is retired before GU(n+1)'s first
