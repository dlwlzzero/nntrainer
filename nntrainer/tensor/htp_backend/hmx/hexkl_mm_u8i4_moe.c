 * @brief  A whole MoE FFN layer -- every expert -- in one call
 * @see    https://github.com/nntrainer/nntrainer
 * @author SeungHui Lee <shsh1004.lee@samsung.com>
 * @bug    No known bugs except for NYI items
 *
 * Design, and the arithmetic every constant here is checked against:
 * docs/htp_attention/46_moe_resident_kernel_design.md.
 *
 * Two things about this file are deliberate and easy to undo by accident.
 *
 * THE WEIGHTS ARE NOT DOUBLE-BUFFERED. Two copies of gate_up and down is
 * 10.5 MB against an 8.3 MB arena, so instead each buffer is reused with a
 * time offset: while expert e's down matmul runs, the gate_up buffer is
 * already dead and e+1's gate_up is pulled into it. That is the whole
 * reason the layout fits, and it is what keeps the weight DMA hidden --
 * doc 44 section 14.3 measured what happens when it is not: the u8in call
 * has no activation quant for the DMA to hide behind and all 5.18 ms/layer
 * of it is exposed.
 *
 * THE POOL RUNS ONE JOB BEHIND THE HMX. Each staged batch's epilogue
 * (dequant, or dequant+SwiGLU) and each block's scatter are submitted to
 * the worker pool and retired only when the buffer they read or write is
 * about to be reused: two accumulator staging buffers alternate under the
 * HMX issue, res_f32 has its own region rather than aliasing gate, and a
 * block's scatter runs under the next block's first gate_up batch. Every wait
 * is placed where the dependency actually is, and each is timed, so the
 * profile's DEQUANT and SCATTER columns now read the exposed part, not the
 * work. Moving a submit or a wait without re-deriving who reads what is how
 * this breaks -- silently, as a plausible wrong output.

 *
 * The HMX computes 64 rows whatever the count, 252 us a block; 13.6 of a
 * prefill call's 45.6 blocks are an expert's second block of 10-20 rows
 * (doc 47 section 14). A block of at most MOE_TAIL_MAX_ROWS rows after a
 * full one is taken off the HMX and computed on the pool's background lane
 * as three gated jobs -- gate/up column pairs with the fused SwiGLU
 * epilogue, the requantization, down columns with their dequant -- reading
 * the weights straight from the arena (DDR) and the activation from the
 * packed slots. Every job of every tail is queued at the start of the call,
 * in expert order, so the lane grinds through them under the whole HMX
 * loop, and each tail's rows are scattered by the job that scatters its
 * expert's last HMX block. The int32 sums are the HMX's own (see
 * hvx_gemm_u8i4_wh.h) and the epilogues are the same functions on the same
 * numbers, so the output is byte for byte what the all-HMX path produced.
 *
 * ponytail: one tail at a time -- the gating serializes them, so the
 * staging below is shared. If tails ever outrun the shadow, two staging
 * sets and pairwise gating is the upgrade. And the threshold is a guess
 * until measured: HVX_GEMM_U8I4_MAX_ROWS (16) is where a row-group unit is
 * ~20 us; the average tail here is 10-20 rows.
