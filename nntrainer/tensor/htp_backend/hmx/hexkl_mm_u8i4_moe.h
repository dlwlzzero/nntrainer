 * Replaces the 64 FastRPC calls a MoE layer costs today (32 experts x
 * gate_up_swiglu + layer_u8in) with one. Design and the VTCM arithmetic:
 * docs/htp_attention/46_moe_resident_kernel_design.md.
 *
 * What moves onto the DSP with it: the token gather, the routing-weight
 * multiply and the scatter-add, all of which the ARM side does today at a
 * measured 6.3 ms/layer (doc 44 section 15.1).
 *
 * The activation and output are plain pointers and this file does not care
 * where they live. Today the skel wrapper passes buffers FastRPC moved;
 * when the residual stream stays on the DSP (doc 45 Phase D) another
 * wrapper passes DSP-side addresses and the kernel is unchanged.
