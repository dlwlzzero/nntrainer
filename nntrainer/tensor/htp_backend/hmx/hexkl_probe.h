 * @brief  Five counters that split layer_run's time (Tier 0 measurement)
 * @see    https://github.com/nntrainer/nntrainer
 * @author SeungHui Lee <shsh1004.lee@samsung.com>
 * @bug    No known bugs except for NYI items
 *
 * The two-parameter cost model (31_dataflow_as_built.md 3) attributes 75-96%
 * of attention DSP time to "accumulator readout", but that bucket is really
 * two calls -- acc_read_int32 (HMX acc -> VTCM, vendor) and
 * copy_32b_to_submatrix (VTCM -> DDR, ours) -- and which of the two carries
 * the 52 us decides whether the fix is dequant-from-VTCM or bypassing HMX for
 * small M. These counters exist to answer that one question and go away with
 * the rest of the debug surface (MHA_HTP_PLAN.md 9.5).
 *
 * Globals, not parameters: threading a stats struct through the layer_run
 * signature would touch every caller for scaffolding. The DSP session is
 * single-threaded through these calls, and the counters are read only by
 * hexkl_attn_u8_forward, which resets them on entry.
