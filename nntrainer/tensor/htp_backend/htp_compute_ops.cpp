 * @bug    No known bugs except for NYI items
 * @brief  HTP (Hexagon/HMX) ComputeOps entry point.
 *
 * Compiled only when ENABLE_HEXKL is defined.
 *
 * HtpComputeOps overrides exactly the ops it accelerates and inherits the
 * CPU implementation of everything else from CpuComputeOps.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT derive from the abstract ComputeOps base the way
 * ClComputeOps does. A layer's engine covers every tensor in it, not just
 * the ones this backend has a kernel for: Lfm2MoELayer's router gate is
 * FP32 by construction (lfm2_moe_layer.cpp keeps gate and expert_bias
 * unquantized), so with engine=htp its dot() reaches sgemm_fp32, which has
 * no supports_* guard and no fallback of its own in FloatTensor::dot. Off
 * the abstract base that threw "ComputeOps::sgemm_fp32 not implemented by
 * this backend" on the first prefill. CpuComputeOps is stateless, so
 * inheriting it costs nothing and makes every unaccelerated op behave the
 * way it does with engine=cpu.
 *
 * gemm_q4_0_accel_fp32 is the first kernel: one FastRPC call per Q4_0 FC
 * dot(), single weight, single activation -- hexkl_mm_u8i4_layer_run with
 * n_handles=1 underneath. It is Tier 1 of docs/htp_attention/
 * 40_moe_ffn_htp_task.md section 3 and benefits every FC layer under
 * engine=htp, not just the LFM2 MoE FFN that motivated this task.
 *
 * gemm_q4_0_batch_fp32 is the same call with n_handles > 1: several
 * weights sharing one activation (LFM2-MoE decode's selected experts'
 * gate_up projections against the single routed token) go out as one
 * FastRPC call so hexkl_mm_u8i4_layer_run can prefetch the next handle's
 * weight while the current one computes.

   * @brief NNTR_L2_DIFF: the one control neither L2 attempt ever applied.
   *
   * Both attempts were gated on unittest_hvx_mm_u8i4's SNR against
   * fill_deterministic weights and activations, passed at 138-141 dB, and
   * still broke the real model -- so the variable nobody has held fixed is
   * the DATA, not the kernel. This runs the unit test's exact reference
   * (mm_u8i4_layer on gate_up, SwiGLU on the host with expf, mm_u8i4_layer
   * on down) against the split-call path, on THIS model's registered weight
   * bytes and THIS forward's real activation, and reports the SNR per call.
   *
   * It bisects the search in one run:
   *   high SNR -> the kernels agree on real data too, so the fault is on the
   *               ARM side of the call (what is fed in, what is done with
   *               what comes out), not inside the DSP;
   *   low SNR  -> the kernels genuinely disagree on real data, and the
   *               synthetic distribution was hiding it -- the dB number to
   *               chase, with the offending M printed next to it.
   *
   * Debug path: plain heap buffers, three extra FastRPC round trips per
   * expert. Never on unless the env var is.
