/**
 * @brief One n-tile column of C = A x W for @a m rows, exact int32 --
 *        the same numbers the HMX unit produces for the same tiles, since
 *        both are plain integer sums of u8 x i4 products (no rounding
 *        anywhere), so a row computed here and a row computed by the HMX
 *        dequantize to identical bytes.
 *
 * Reads the operands as the HMX sees them: @a act_ah in AH tiles (64 rows
 * x 32 bytes per k-tile at a 2048-byte stride, row r at r*32) and @a wh in
 * WH tiles (32x32 i4, 512 bytes, tile (kt, nt) at (kt*n_col + nt)*512,
 * nibble layout per htp_wh_layout.h: byte (r/8)*128 + c*4 + r%4, low
 * nibble for rows 8g..8g+3, high for 8g+4..8g+7). That layout is what
 * makes this cheap: each 128-byte quarter of a tile is one HVX vector
 * whose lane c already holds the four consecutive k values of column c,
 * which is exactly what vrmpy multiplies against four activation bytes.
 *
 * @param act_ah   the row block's AH tiles, k_tiles of them
 * @param m        rows to compute, 1..HVX_GEMM_U8I4_MAX_ROWS
 * @param k_tiles  reduction length in 32-wide tiles
 * @param wh       the weight's WH bytes (DDR is fine; a column is 2D
 *                 prefetched)
 * @param n_col    the weight's n-tile count (tile row stride)
 * @param nt       the n-tile column to compute
 * @param rows1    non-zero: a lone last row (m = 1, 5, 9, 13) runs the
 *                 one-accumulator loop gemm_row1; zero: every row group
 *                 runs gemm_rows4. The two knobs of #113 -- this one and
 *                 the caller's l2fetch lead -- are independent, so the
 *                 (loop, lead) matrix can be swept; LEDGER rule 26 says
 *                 the choice is a latency-hiding question, not a compute
 *                 one, so there is no a-priori winner.
 * Accumulation order, per output int32: kt ascending, then the four
 * 128-byte quarters g ascending, then the quarter's low-nibble rows before
 * its high-nibble rows, all into one accumulator per row, then one
 * arithmetic shift by 4. Rows go four at a time (gemm_rows4) and, when
 * @a rows1 is set, a lone last row alone (gemm_row1); both follow that
 * order. The integer sums are exact either way, so @a rows1 changes no
 * result bit and the order is documented for the review list, not needed
 * for the equality.
 *
 * @param out      m x 32 int32, row-major, row stride 32 -- the same shape
 *                 hexkl_micro_hmx_acc_read_int32 lands with row_stride 32,
 *                 so the existing dequant passes read it unchanged
