 * @bug    No known bugs except for NYI items
 *
 * The seqn/barrier/futex protocol below is not novel -- it is
 * llama.cpp ggml-hexagon's htp/work-queue.c pattern (same QuRT primitives,
 * same target), trimmed to a single-job-in-flight fork/join: this pool has
 * no multi-slot queue. Two additions since: submit/wait, the same job run
 * without the caller as worker 0, and the background lane (submit_bg), a
 * unit counter workers claim from when the foreground lane has nothing
 * for them. Both keep the one-owner, one-job-per-lane shape.
