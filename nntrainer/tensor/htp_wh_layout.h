 * @bug    No known bugs except for NYI items
 *
 * hexkl_micro_hmx_rm_to_wh_i4 rearranges an int4 weight into the 32x32 tiles
 * the HMX unit reads, and it runs on the DSP. That put the conversion on the
 * model load path, where it is the larger half of a registration that costs
 * 48.2% of prefill (doc 46 section 20), and left the baked bytes on a DSP
 * heap that tops out at 1.89 GB against the 3.9 the model needs.
 *
 * It does not have to be there. A tile is 32x32 i4 = 1024 nibbles = 512
 * bytes = WEIGHT_TILE_BYTES_U8I4 exactly, so there is no room in the output
 * for anything but the values and the transform can only be a permutation of
 * nibbles. Reading that permutation off the device gives:
 *
 *     byte(r,c) = (r/8)*128 + c*4 + (r%4)       nibble = (r/4)%2
 *
 * One byte holds the two ROWS four apart in the same column -- two k values
 * per byte, which is what the reduction wants -- and tiles are k-major,
 * kt*(N/32) + nt, where hexkl_bake_u8i4_worker places each at t*512.
 *
 * Device-verified byte for byte against weight_bake_export at 2048x3584, the
 * model's largest weight, and at a non-square 64x128 so the tile order is
 * checked too (doc 46 section 35.3b). unittest_hvx_mm_u8i4's
 * WhPackReferenceMatchesDspBake is that check and has to keep passing: this
 * header is a copy of a hardware layout, and nothing but the device can say
 * it is still right.
 *
 * Not to be confused with sdkl_cpu_i4_rm_to_i4_wh, whose tile is this one
 * TRANSPOSED -- whSlot(c, r). The two APIs read their source with opposite
 * conventions, of a piece with hexkl_macro_i4_rm_to_i4_wh taking
 * (n_col, n_inner) where sdkl_cpu_i4_rm_to_i4_wh is documented
 * (wt_rows, wt_cols). Deriving this from the library instead of from the
 * kernel under test cost two device rounds, because a square probe hides
 * both the transpose and the argument order.

 * @brief The whole pages of [src, src + len) -- what the arena copy can hand

 *
 * This model's expert weights are 3.9 GB living in ONE contiguous allocation
 * (TensorPool gives every weight a slice of a single aligned_alloc, so
 * Tensor::deallocate() drops a pointer and frees nothing), and the arena
 * needs its own 3.9 GB copy of them. Both at once is more memory than the
 * device has. Dropping each weight's pages right after its copy keeps the
 * peak at one model instead of two. The pointer stays valid and mapped --
 * only the physical pages go, and a read would see zeros -- so nothing that
 * still holds it dangles, which is also why the handle cache may keep using
 * it as a key.
 *
 * Rounds INWARD. A weight's first and last partial page are shared with its
 * neighbours in the pool, and dropping a neighbour's live bytes would be a
 * silently wrong matmul rather than a failure. That keeps at most one page at
 * each end, against a 1.8 MB smallest weight here.
