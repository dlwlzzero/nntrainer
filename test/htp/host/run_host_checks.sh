# What these are and are not. The HMX and HVX primitives are replaced by
# scalar stand-ins in stub/ and in the check itself, so this does NOT
# verify the hardware's arithmetic -- the device tests do that, and this
# would give false confidence if it were read as doing so. What it does
# verify is everything around the arithmetic: which rows each expert gets,
# which weights it uses, that the buffer reuse in the weight DMA pipeline
# does not clobber a live buffer, that the scatter lands on the right
# output row with the right routing weight, that empty and
# multi-block experts work, and that the VTCM layout matches the hand
# arithmetic in docs/htp_attention/46_moe_resident_kernel_design.md.
#
# The DMA stand-in completes immediately, which is the point: a transfer
# issued into a buffer that is still being read shows up as a wrong result
# here rather than as a rare corruption on device.
