/**
 * @brief State held for the lifetime of one nntr_hvx_open()/close() pair.
 *
 * hw_init and the HMX lock happen once in open() rather than per call (doc15
 * §3/§4): every FastRPC entry point in this file reaches its VTCM arena and
 * weight table through the session instead of re-acquiring either. This
 * assumes one open session at a time -- hexkl_micro_hw_init is a singleton
 * DSP resource, so a second concurrent open would contend for the same VTCM
 * arena and HMX lock. nntrainer opens exactly one HTP session per process,
 * so that is not a real constraint today; it would need addressing before
 * this skel served more than one client process at once.

/** @brief How many host arenas one session can have mapped at once. The
 *  whole-model plan needs 3.9 GB in chunks of at most 1 GiB (rpcmem/ION
 *  allocation size, doc 45 Gate 0b), so four -- but the DSP refused the
 *  fourth 1 GiB mapping (doc 46 section 39), and the host now halves its
 *  request down to 64 MiB to find where that ceiling actually falls. The
 *  tail of a halving sequence is what needs the room: this is a table of
 *  three-word structs, so the slots cost nothing next to being wrong. */
